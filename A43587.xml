         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p n="2">2. But may the ſoul ſay, if it be ſo cheap, it may be its of as little worth, too dear of taking <hi>gratis,</hi> things of light price are often of as light uſe, and anſwer their rate, by being unprofitable, will it do me any good? O yes, its of vaſt advantage; if you take pains for any thing elſe, you do but ſpend money for that which is no Bread, but if you obtain Goſpel-Grace, <hi>you eat that which is good, and your ſoul ſhall delight it ſelf in fatneſs,</hi> ver. 2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But may I have a ſhare in theſe Mercies, ſhall I not miſs of them, and when I once have them ſhall I not loſe them again? I am
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32941:17"/>but tantalized if I ſee ſuch ſweet morſels and cannot reach them, and I ſhall be more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable if I taſte ſuch pleaſant dainties, and have them ſnatcht away: he anſwers to the firſt, <hi>all ſhall be made over to you by a Covenant, and to the ſecond they are the ſure mercies of</hi> David, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But, alas may a poor ſoul ſay, this is Childrens meat, what have doggs to do with theſe dainties, I am a ſinner of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, ſalvation is of the Jews, and for the Jews; is there any hope for ſuch ſtrangers to the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> Yes, Jeſus Chriſt is given for a witneſs to the people, to all people, <hi>i. e.</hi> Gentiles,

               <p>The Text falls under the third Argument, and contains,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A double duty, <hi>hear, come, i. e.</hi> believe, obey.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A double promiſe, of <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>Covenant.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Your ſoul ſhall live;</hi> life is the flower and foundation of all outward mercies, but ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al life tranſcends a corporal temporal life, which is but a dying life, or living death; <hi>Grace is the life of the ſoul.</hi> Spiritual life is the ſeed-plot of eternal life in Glory: mankind loſt life by hearing the charming temptations of the ſubtle Serpent: life is recovered by hearing the gracious words of life from Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Hear, and your ſouls ſhall live.</hi>

                  </note> the expreſſion hath alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the ancient practice of entring Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, which was by cutting a Beaſt in two parts, and the parties Covenanting going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thoſe parts, to note that after that manner ſhall that mans members be divided that ſhall violate that ſolemn Covenant: See the practice, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.17, 18. <hi>Jer.</hi> 34.18.</p>
               <p>Now the great Contents of this Covenant are expreſſed in theſe words which I have pickt out, and pitcht upon to ſpeak fully to, <hi>Even the ſure mercies of</hi> David: which contain,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſumm of the Covenant, <hi>i. e. mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The nature of thoſe mercies, <hi>i. e. ſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſubject of the mercies, <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is not much difficulty in the words, only 'tis diſputed what is meant by <hi>David</hi> here. Now in Scripture <hi>David</hi> is taken, 1. For literal <hi>David.</hi> 2. For myſtical <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> it may be applicable very properly both wayes here.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It may be taken for the perſon of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> the Son of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and then the mercies of <hi>David</hi> are the choice promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that God made with his ſervant <hi>David,</hi> deſcribed in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.13-17. and in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. Some make the firſt words of that <hi>Pſalm</hi> to be the title of it, and render it thus, <hi>I will ſing of the mercies of</hi> David, becauſe Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with <hi>David</hi> is abundantly held forth in that Pſalm. But this phraſe doth rather allude to 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.42. where <hi>Solomon</hi> thus
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32941:18"/>prayes, <hi>Remember the mercies of</hi> David <hi>thy Servant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. By <hi>David</hi> is meant <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> who is of the ſeed of <hi>David</hi> according to the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3.
<note place="margin">Act. 13.23.</note> and called by this name of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> frequently in the Old Teſtament, as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.23, 34. <hi>ch.</hi> 37.24, 25. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5. and I do rather conceive this to be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the words, than the former, for theſe two reaſons. 1. Becauſe in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where theſe words are quoted, the Holy Ghoſt applyes it to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.34. <hi>I will give you the ſure mercies of</hi> David; indeed the Greek renders it different from the Original of the Old Teſtament, for thus they read it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Septuagint: in Engliſh, <hi>the faithful holy things of</hi> David, but all comes unto one, for the mercies of the Covenant are holy things; But obſerve the ſcope of that quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the <hi>Acts,</hi> which is to prove Chriſts Reſurrection, <hi>for if Chriſt had not riſen from the dead, the promiſes had not been made good,</hi> ſo that ſtill it relates to Chriſt. 2. Another conſideration that moves me to conceive that by <hi>David</hi> here is meant <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is what follows in the <hi>fourth verſe, I have given him, (i.e. David</hi> before mentioned or <hi>Chriſt) for a witneſs to the people, (i.e.</hi> a witneſs to teſtifie Gods veracity in performing all his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;) ſo then the words may be thus read, I will make an everlaſting Covenant with you, according to the ſure mercies of <hi>David, i. e.</hi> the Meſſiah, who is to come, the mercies
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32941:19"/>before promiſed, and to be exhibited in and by him in the fulneſs of time: the words are but few,
<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
                  </note> being but three, yet they are full of ſenſe and ſignificancy, and are big-bellyed, travelling with the precious myſteries of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-grace.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only name ſome Doctrinal obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by the way from the Text, and pitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one.</p>
               <p>Doct. 1. <hi>The Covenant of Grace is made up of mercies, its a compound of mercies, the root, the branches, the top, the bottom of this Chariot is love, grace, grace, all free-grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Covenant-mercies are ſure mercies, they are not like the uncertain riches of this world, the true treaſure is a ſure treaſure, the better part that cannot be taken away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The ſure mercies of the Covenant are</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids <hi>portion: take</hi> David <hi>here literally and Saints in him, ſo it ſignifies beloved: all Gods</hi> Davids <hi>or beloved ones have right to Covenant-mercies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt alone doth make ſure all the mercies of the Covenant: ſo take it in the latter acceptation, as</hi> David <hi>imports the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall rather give you the ſubſtance of the Text, and the fore-mentioned Doctrines in this one Propoſition.</p>

FOR the firſt point, <hi>What are the mercies of the Covenant:</hi> and here I might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the way by declaring what a Covenant is, and give ſome deſcription of this New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and diſtinctions about it; but I ſhall rather wave that, becauſe it's ſo abundantly done already by ſo many able hands. Only for our preſent purpoſe, take notice, that in all Contracts or Covenants,

                     </hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 227.</note> yea in any ordinary Conveyance, there are four things very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, yea and eſſentially requiſite. 1. There is the parties Covenanting. 2. The Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration paid, or laid down. 3. The conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons required and performed. 4. The tenour and graunt in which it runs, or the priviledge to be injoyed, upon the conditions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, called in our writings the <hi>haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> or the thing that we muſt have and hold:</p>
               <p>Now all theſe are either expreſly or impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly held forth in one Scripture, which is <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10.1.
<note place="margin">Heb. 8.10.</note> There is the parties Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting, I and the houſe of <hi>Iſrael, [this is the Covenant that I will make with the houſe of</hi> Iſrael.] 2. Here is the conſideration evidently
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:32941:21"/>implyed in theſe words, <hi>[after thoſe days] i.e.</hi> after thoſe dayes of Types, Shadows, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, <hi>in the fulneſs of time, the Meſſiah ſhall come, who is the ſubſtance, and will ſatisfie divine juſtice, and make an Attonement.</hi> 3. Here is the condition of the Covenant, plainly expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>[I will put my Laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts] i. e.</hi> I will give that which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, I will put within them a principle of Grace that they may love me, believe in me, repent for ſin, and obey the Goſpel: that's the third. 4. Here's the grant, or good to be enjoyed, which is the end and reſult of all the former, viz. <hi>[I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a people,] i.e.</hi> whatſoever I am, or have, or can do, who am omnipotent, ſhall be imployed for their good; or whatſoever they would chooſe a God for, or deſire to be in a God, that will I be to them, with whom I contract this Covenant, and I will own them as my peculiar people. Now the mercies of the Covenant conſiſt in theſe four particulars, eſpecially in the laſt.</p>
               <p>I ſhall a little open theſe, that we may the better find out the mercies wrapt in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The parties that enter this Covenant, are God, and man; Oh the infinite diſtance and vaſt diſproportion! <hi>quantus quantillo?</hi> Heaven makes a match with earth, the great Creator with a mortal creature, the glorious King with a ſilly beggar! is not this a rich mercy? ſhall the Cedar in <hi>Lebanon</hi> contract a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:32941:21"/>League not only with the contemptible ſhrub, but with the pricking offenſive thiſtle? ſhall the Sun of Righteouſneſs convey beams of love to ſuch worthleſs worms, yea to ſuch ſtinking dung-hills? ſhall the beauty of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be confederate with ſorry man who is but a lump of vanity or maſs of impurity? Yet thus it is, and this is tranſcendent mercy; there's mercy in a Covenant, God might have dealt with man in a way of abſolute ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, and done with man even as he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without giving us account of his matters; but he treats with man in a rational way, above the capacity of other creatures: God takes man up to parly and treat with him, as though he were his equal,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 8.4.</note> 
                  <hi>what is man that thou art thus mindful of him? or the Son of man that thou viſiteſt him?</hi> this mutual ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is infinite condeſcention on Gods part, and advancement on mans: man, only man of all the Creatures is the ſubject of this Covenant, Angels had no need of it, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils had no hope by it, bruit Creatures were not capable of it, only man, and fallen man hath intereſt in it, and benefit by it. Oh the mercy there is in a Covenant of reconciliation! even after man had turned bankrupt, ſpent a fair eſtate, broken Covenant, and brought himſelf into a deſperate caſe, that yet God ſhould forget what was paſt, enter into a new and better Covenant, betruſt him with a new ſtock, and yet lay help (not upon fooliſh mans weak ſhoulders, but) upon one that's mighty to ſave? Oh rich, O tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:32941:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>Love! this leads us to the ſecond thing in this Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The conſideration paid, that's Jeſus Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Joh. 4.10.</note> and he is eminently the gift of God, ſuch a gift as never came out of the hands of God, and was never received by the hands of mortal man, a rich and inriching gift, a gift proceeding from love, <hi>ſo God loved the world, that he gave his Son,</hi> Joh. 3.16. Chriſt is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral wayes a gift, 1. <hi>Nobis,</hi> to us, 1 Cor. 1.30. <hi>who of God is made unto us wiſdom.</hi> 2. <hi>Pro nobis,</hi> for us, Gal. 2.20. <hi>Who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi> 3. <hi>Prae nobis,</hi> before us, as an example, copy and pattern, as he ſuffered for us, ſo he left us an example, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21.4. <hi>In nobis,</hi> in us, <hi>ſo Chriſt is ſaid to dwell in our hearts by faith,</hi> Eph. 3.17. thus Chriſt is given to believers by ſanctification, and inhabitation of his ſpirit. Now, 'tis the ſecond way principally whereby Chriſt is the conſideration or price paid in this new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>viz.</hi> as he is given for us, a valuable conſideration to pacifie wrath and ſatisfie juſtice: thus is Jeſus Chriſt the <hi>Lutron</hi> or price of our Redemption, <hi>we are bought with a price,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.20. ſuch a price as never was paid, men pay money to purchaſe great poſſeſſions, <hi>but we were not redeemed with corruptible things as Silver and Gold— but with blood, yea with the precious blood of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.18, 19. without ſhedding of blood there could be no remiſſion, yet the blood of Bulls or Goats could never take away ſin;
<note place="margin">Heb. 9.22, 12.</note> nay the blood of all the men upon earth could
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:32941:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>never waſh away the guilt of the leaſt ſin; no no, it muſt be the blood of the immaculate Lamb, the blood of God; ſo called from the union of the two natures, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of idioms or properties: and this is the price paid, the Father found out a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.6.</note> and our dear Saviour gave himſelf a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; certainly this is a tranſcendent mercy of the New Covenant. I diſpute not thoſe nice Controverſies, whether God could not have pardoned and ſaved man without the conſideration of Chriſts undertakings; or how God in juſtice can charge guilt and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon an innocent perſon; this I am ſure is Gods way of ſaving ſouls, and we muſt not diſpute but believe, that Jeſus Chriſt is the Mediatour of the Covenant, and the price of our Redemption, as God-man; and this is the Marrow of the rich mercy and deep myſterie contained in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In a Covenant is contained the couditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof; what God requires of us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we can have no benefit by the Covenant; theſe alſo are to be reckoned as mercies of the Covenant on Gods part, as well as duties on our part, for they are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured and effected in us, as well as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and required by God. <hi>Luther</hi> makes this to be the main difference betwixt the two Covenants; the Covenant of works requires obedience but gives no ſtrength; but the Covenant of Grace ingageth the Grace of God for the Elects performance of the conditions; hence it is, that what
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:32941:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Law commandeth,
<note place="margin">Quod lex imperat, gratia impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trat: Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelium dat quod lex exigit: <hi>Aug. de ſpir. &amp; lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera—</hi>
                  </note> the Goſpel promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; what God requireth, Chriſt procureth; what juſtice demandeth, our dear ſaviour pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſeth and worketh by his ſpirit in the heart: faith is the great Goſpel-condition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Chriſt with all his benefits become ours, but faith is the gift of God, and <hi>none can come to Chriſt, except the Father draw him,</hi> Joh. 6.44. Alas it is as impoſſible to believe in Chriſt as to keep the Moral Law from princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of corrupted nature; our ſtate had been ſad, and forlorn ſtill, if God had not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to work the faith which he requireth;
<note place="margin">Duce D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o venitur ad deum.</note> 'tis only the arm of omnipotency that can draw the ſoul to Chriſt, Jeſus is the only Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and finiſher of our faith,
<note place="margin">Heb. 12.2. Eph. 1.19.</note> there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding greatneſs of his power to all them that believe put forth to create an act of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith; all they that have felt it, can teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that this is a rich mercy, and this is one of the mercies of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>More particularly there are four choice diſpoſitions promiſed in the Covenant of Grace, which are Covenant-mercies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Saving illumination, Jer. 31.34. <hi>they ſhall all know me ſaith the Lord;</hi> by nature we are blind and blockiſh creatures, but the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant brings light and ſight to the ignorant &amp; erring ſinner; and Oh what a mercy is it to know God and Chriſt, and ſin and miſery, and duty and felicity, to know Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths and Goſpel-myſteries, our own hearts and the ſweetneſs of Grace; heaven and the way thither? certainly ſuch ſaving knowledge
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32941:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>is worth a world: truly ſuch light is ſweet, and a pleaſant thing it is for the eye of the ſoul to behold the Sun of Righteouſneſs; and the beauty of Heaven: what blind <hi>Bartimeus</hi> would not own it as a rich mercy to have his eyes opened? and is it not a bleſſed thing to be tranſlated out of Aegyptian darkneſs into this marvelous light? Oh happy are the eyes that are annointed with the new-covenant eye-ſalve, and behold Coeleſtial objects through this Divine optick of faith, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come faithful guides to the feet of an holy life!</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sound humiliation, this is another Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-mercy, Ezek. 11.19. — <hi>I will take the ſtony heart out of their fleſh, and will give them an heart of fleſh:</hi> a broken heart is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of many Sacrifices; an hard heart is the greateſt judgement, and a ſoft heart the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt mercy; repentance is Gods gift bound up in the Covenant of Grace: our ſweet and bleſſed Redeemer is exalted as well to be a Prince that he may give Repentance, as to be a Saviour to give unto us remiſſion of ſins: Oh what a mercy is the ſpirit of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? they that have this Godly ſorrow ſhall never need to ſorrow for it; ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance needs not to be repented of: <hi>bleſſed are they that mourn for ſin, for they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce; happy ſuch as ſow in tears, for they ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eap in joy!</hi> certainly a Converted ſinner looks upon a repenting heart as a rich mercy: one penitent tear is an orient pearl, of more worth than the whole Creation, a bleeding
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:32941:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſoul is a bleſſed ſight in the eyes of God and man, it layes the Chriſtian under the promiſe of the Covenant, and qualifies it for remiſſion and the ſweeteſt conſolation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another Covenant-mercy with reſpect to the condition is heart-ſanctification, Ezek. 36.25. <hi>I will ſprinkle clean water upon you, and you ſhall be clean;</hi> this is the mercy that <hi>David</hi> is ſo importunate for, <hi>create in me a clean heart,</hi> no leſs than creation will effect it; a putting off the old man, and putting on the new in a ſound Regeneration, is a miraculous mercy. Oh what would a poor ſoul give for dominion over ſome ſpecial corruptions, and power to reſiſt temptations; why here it is, this mercy of mortification (which is alſo a Chriſtians duty) is infolded in this bleſſed Goſpel-Covenant, ſo that ſin ſhall not have Dominion over them that are under this Covenant of Grace: a Chriſtian can do more to mortifie ſin, and Crucifie the fleſh than another man; every word of God hath a cleanſing vertue, <hi>now you are clean,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>through the word that I have ſpoken to you;</hi> but the promiſes of the Covenant have a direct and immediate tendency to cleanſing, 2 Cor. 7.1. <hi>having theſe promiſes,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the fore-mentioned Covenant) <hi>let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs, both of fleſh and ſpirit:</hi> it is only the Goſpel Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that can make Evangelically holy: and holineſs is the image of God, the beauty of a ſoul, the duty of a Chriſtian, and the mercy of the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:32941:24" rendition="simple:additions"/> 4. A ſpiritual converſation; this is alſo included in the Covenant, Ezek. 36.27. <hi>I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes, and ye ſhall keep my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and do them:</hi> Oh what a bleſſed thing is it to have a heart to love, and fear, and ſerve the Lord? Oh what a mercy to be ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to perform holy duties; to walk with God in all wayes of well-pleaſing!
<note place="margin">Jer. 31.33.</note> to have the Law of God written in the heart, and tranſcribed in the life! yea to keep Gods commands with eaſe, alacrity, and compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, not to have them grievous but pleaſant to the ſoul; and thus it is when the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian acts from an innate principle of Grace and Holineſs: well, this is the promiſed and purchaſed condition of the New Covenant; God undertakes to put a new habit into the ſoul, his fear which is the beginning of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and principle of obedience: God gives the ſpirit of prayer, the ſpirit of power, love, and of a ſound mind;
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.9.</note> he promiſeth to give them one heart and one way, that they may fear him for ever:
<note place="margin">Jer. 32.39.</note> Oh what rich mercies of the New Covenant are theſe?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet the great mercies of the Covenant are behind, under the next head, for a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, contract, conveyance contains the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendum</hi> or grant, reflecting advantage to the party Covenanting, and that in theſe words, <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> this is repeated fifteen or ſixteen times in the Scriptures: this, this is the mercy of the New Covenant, the mercy of mercies, the flower, cream and quint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:32941:25"/>of all mercies, God gives himſelf to the ſoul by Covenant, and what greater or better gift can he beſtow? if he ſhould give us all the world and deny himſelf, we are miſerable beggars; if he give himſelf and nothing of the world we are truly rich; if we have God we have all things, if we want God we want all things:

THE third Head to be opened is more particularly to ſhew what is the way of making ſure theſe Covenant-mercies, how God doth it; Now there are ſeveral ſteps of making a thing ſure amongſt men, and God hath uſed the ſame means (and ſome degrees more) to make theſe mercies ſure to the Children of men.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Men are wont to paſs their word; When they promiſe any thing upon the word of an honeſt man, they expect credit; and among men this is current, and the God of Heaven is worthy to be believed upon his bare word (if I may ſo ſpeak) for he is a God that cannot lye nor deny himſelf, <hi>yea let God be true and every man a lyar;</hi> even a <hi>Balaam</hi> is convinced of it, and muſt profeſs it, Numb. 23.19. <hi>God is not a man that he ſhould ly —hath he ſaid, and ſhall he not do it? or hath he ſpoken and ſhall he not make it good?</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:32941:33"/>the unchangeable God hath ingaged his Word in the New Covenant: the Patriarchs of old gave credit to all that God ſpake by dreams, viſions and revelations, as <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi>

               <p n="9">9. Another ſtep that God hath gone is the various wayes that God hath taken to make us know theſe ſure mercies, and thereby to aſſure us thereof; As,
<note place="margin">Mat. 3.17. Cap. 17.5.</note> 1. An audible intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible voice from Heaven, at Chriſts Baptiſm, and in his Transfiguration, <hi>this is my beloved Son in whom I am well-pleaſed,</hi> and this voice the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith he heard in the Holy Mount, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17, 18. ſo that theſe Goſpel mercies are not deviſed Fables, but divine Oracles of undoubted truth. 2. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant preachings of honeſt and unbiaſſed men, that were eye-witneſſes of his glory; they give clear evidence of their hatred of evil, love of truth and goodneſs: and they could not be perverted by any ſelfiſh ends of profit, pleaſure, or honour; for theſe were not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, promiſed or attained: Nay afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and perſecution was their known portion, and therefore certainly could not, would not couzen the world with lyes to get that which was not attainable in that way. 3. God hath adorned men with admirable gifts to enable them to demonſtrate the certainty and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of theſe Covenant-mercies; extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary gifts in the Apoſtles dayes, as extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:32941:37"/>prophecying,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.8, 9, 10.</note> ſinging, healing diſeaſes, working miracles, diſcerning ſpirits, divers kinds of tongues: ſo that all Nations might hear theſe [<hi>magnalia dei</hi>] in their own dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect;
<note place="margin">Act. 2.6. Eph. 4.8.</note> and now they are tranſlated into all languages: and God hath continued to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute miniſterial gifts for the Churches ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and edification. 4. Yea, he ſent his own Son to be the Preacher as well as Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer of theſe ſure mercies; <hi>he ſpake at ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times, and in divers manners in times paſt by the Prophets, but in theſe laſt dayes he hath ſpoken to us by his Son,</hi> Heb. 1.12. the more to conciliate in us reverence and credence; for he ſaith, <hi>ſurely they will reverence my Son:</hi> certainly he will declare to us the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God, <hi>for he was in the boſome of the Father, and came from thence for that very end to declare Gods mind,</hi> Joh. 1.18.5 Yea he hath raiſed Jeſus Chriſt from the dead; ſo that we have a Preacher ſent from the grave to aſſure us of the truth of theſe high myſteries and ſweet mercies; ſo the rich man could ſay in hell, if one went to them from the dead, they will repent, and believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.30. now our dear Saviour himſelf was dead and is alive, and as he is declared to be the Son of God by his Reſurrection from the dead,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.4.</note> ſo after his Reſurrection he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the great things of God, confirming his Diſciples in the truth of things formerly delivered, and giving further teſtimonies and inſtructions, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.44-49.6. Still another way of manifeſtation is clear and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:32941:37"/>chriſtal Ordinances, in which as in a fair glaſs we may behold both the face of God, and the choiceſt mercies of the Covenant; here you may not only hear the voice of God, but ſee Jeſus Chriſt evidently ſet forth, cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before your eyes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his bleſſed body and blood are obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gods Grace in giving Chriſt, Chriſts love in giving himſelf, his body broken for our food, his blood ſhed for the remiſſion of our ſins, and all the benefits of this new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. 7. Another way more yet of the Lords manifeſting theſe mercies, and ſo making them ſure is the ſanctifying and ſatisfying illumination of ſouls by his holy ſpirit, by this holy unction they know all things, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.20. <hi>God hath revealed them unto us by his ſpirit,</hi> in 1 Cor. 2.10, 12. now the ſpirit comes with conviction and demonſtration, anſwers all the ſouls doubts and cavils, and leaves it without diſpute and haeſitancy: ſo that the believing ſoul cannot but ſay, they are ſure mercies; he dare not deny this for a world.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Yet there is one other way whereby God doth make ſure theſe mercies of the Covenant, and that is, marriage-knot, a mutual and matrimonial ingagement in the perpetual and inviolable bond of the Covenant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Chriſt and the ſoul are inſeparably linked together, and this relates to the particular application of theſe Covenant-mercies, and compleats all the former; for ſaith the poor ſoul, I do not queſtion but theſe mercies
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:32941:38"/>are ſure in themſelves, in their own nature, and ſure to ſome, but are they ſo to me? what ways may I be aſſured of my title thereunto and intereſt therein? now this the Lord doth make good by entring into that ſweet and familiar relation with his people of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 54.5. Jer. 3.14. Rom. 7.4.</note> 
                  <hi>thy maker is thy husband, and I am marryed to you,</hi> ſaith the Lord, a believing ſoul is dead to the Law, that he may be marryed to Chriſt, and our heavenly husband <hi>hateth puting away,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mal. 2.16.</note> once marryed to Chriſt and for ever mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to him, death it ſelt breaks not this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-knot, nay it faſtens and heightens it; here Chriſt and the ſoul are but as it were contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there the marriage is ſolemnized with the acclamations of glorious Angels, and glorified Saints, for, ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 Cor. 11.2. <hi>I have eſpouſed you to one husband, that I may preſent you as a chaſt Virgin to Chriſt:</hi> now ſouls are fitting for that great ſolemnity, <hi>when the marriage of the Lamb ſhall come that the bride is made ready;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 19.7.</note> ſhe is making her ſelf ready in this world, ſhe is marryed at the illuſtrious day of Chriſts ſecond appearing: ſo then this marriage-knot cannot be broken ſince it is compleated in glory. But yet more particularly, conſider that remarkable Text in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2.19, 20. wherein the mercies of the Covenant are made over in a way of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial relation; And <hi>I will betroth thee unto me for ever,</hi> &amp;c. in which Scripture there are four things that may aſſure the heart of the firmneſs of theſe Covenant-mercies, 1. The Author and Husband <hi>I,</hi> the great <hi>Jehovah,</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:32941:38"/>the infinite God, the Creator of Heaven and Earth, who ſpeaks and it is done, who works, and who can let it? it is he that ſaith, <hi>I will betroth thee,</hi> and who can forbid the banes of Matrimony? who is able to hinder this conjunction? 2. Here is the doubling of the phraſe for greater certainty and ſecurity, <hi>I will betroth thee, yea I will betroth thee;</hi> fear not it ſhall be done: nay the third time it's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preated, v. 20. <hi>I will even betroth thee,</hi> what can any ſay more to aſſure a ſuſpicious bride of a firm contract and marriage, <hi>q. d.</hi> I will have thee, thou ſhalt have me, do not diſtruſt me, we will be marryed; all this God ſaith to meet with the incredulity of a guilty ſoul, that through fear deſponds, and dare ſcarce look upon it as poſſible, or credible: Yet, 3. Here is the term and date of the Marriage, it was not for a week, moneth, year, ſeven years, no nor an hundred years only; nay it is not only during life, as other Marriages are made, but it is for <hi>ever,</hi> unto <hi>all eternity,</hi> it never fails, it laſts as long as the ſoul laſts; that's a long day, other marriages are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, terminable, faileable,
<note place="margin">Rom. 7.2.</note> and <hi>death looſeth a Woman from the Law of her Husband;</hi> but this is marriage confirmed, and compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at death, and endures for evermore. And then 4. The terms, conditions, and the manner of Marriage ſpeak the ſureneſs of this Covenant, and the mercies thereof, obſerve it; Loving-kindneſs is the motive to it, and mercies are the ſouls joynture, righteouſneſs, judgement, faithfulneſs are the

Beſides conſider, loving-kindneſs is the beginning, middle, and end of the match, he fetcheth arguments out of his own boſome to enter into this parlee, and after he hath contracted this friendſhip, and intimate relation, the ſame loving-kindneſs will perſwade him to maintain it; nay now his truth and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs is ingaged, and he will be faithful in performing all his promiſes: Conſider that notable Text, Mic. 7.20. <hi>thou wilt perform the truth to</hi> Jacob, <hi>and the mercy to</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>which thou haſt ſworn unto our fathers from the dayes of old:</hi> mark, it is mercy to <hi>Abraham</hi> becauſe made with him, but its truth to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and now is a kind of debt

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:32941:41"/>adde to all this his fidelity, that as <hi>Moſes</hi> was faithful as a <hi>ſteward,</hi> much more is <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a <hi>Son</hi> faithful to him that appointed him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.2-6. Well now, lay all theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſurely we need not queſtion the certainty of Covenant-mercies. Since Chriſt hath ſufficiency, authority, and fidelity, and is thus abundantly qualified for carrying on this Goſpel-deſign, he both can and will make good the mercies of the Covenant to the heirs of the promiſe; eſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Covenant of Redemption, which is an admirable inſuring act of free-grace, ingaging all the perſons of the Sacred Trinity to carry on this work, eſpecially God the Son of whom we are now ſpeaking, this Covenant of Redemption is that mutual compact be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God the Father and the Son concerning the ſaving of loſt man, wherein each did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to act his part in this great affair, as thus, God <hi>the father</hi> doth elect a certain number whom Chriſt was to Redeem, he was to part with his beloved Son out of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome whiles he came to the earth to do this great work,
<note place="margin">Iſa 42.1, 4, 6.</note> he was to uphold him, incourage him, put his ſpirit into him, call him in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, hold his hand, keep him, and give him for a Covenant of the people, give him to ſee his ſeed;

                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 2.8.</note>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:32941:41"/>this is the ingagement on the Fathers part, and then the Lord Jeſus, <hi>the Son</hi> of God promiſed the Father that he would aſſume the humane nature, and ſo become man, putting himſelf into the ſinners ſtead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming his ſurety, fulfill all righteouſneſs, by obeying the Moral Law, ſuffering for our breach of it, be betrayed, impriſoned, accuſed, condemned, crucified, buried, that he ſhould riſe from the dead, aſcend into Heaven, ſit at Gods right hand, intercede for Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this part that Chriſt acted is fully laid down in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. throughout: this was the great tranſaction betwixt the Father and the Son from all Eternity: that there was ſuch a mutual agreement; See Titus 1.2.

                  <hi>in hope of eternal life which God that cannot lye promiſed before the world began,</hi> to whom did God promiſe any thing before man was Created? certainly he promiſed ſomething to Jeſus Chriſt concerning mans Redemption as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned; ſuch a gracious plot was laid, and compact made betwixt the Father and the Son, and he cannot lye nor deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: So 2 Tim. 1.9. <hi>who hath ſaved us— according to his own purpoſe and grace which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the world began,</hi> i. e. as Chriſt was a common perſon, as head, inſtead of the elect, ſo we were given to him by this Covenant, and that from all eternity, but how come we to know this, that are but of Yeſterday; and ſo dim-ſighted that we cannot ſee afar off? Why <hi>ver.</hi> 10. it is now made manifeſt by the appearing of our
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:32941:42"/>Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>who hath aboliſhed death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the Goſpel:</hi> for Chriſt revealeth all the ſecrets that were lockt up in the boſome of the Father. Well then, if this was the mutual ſtipulation betwixt the Father and the Son, there is no queſtion but they will be faithful to each other; in the Old Teſtament God the Father truſted God the Son upon his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to lay down his life, and ſo brought thouſands of ſouls to Heaven before ever Chriſt was incarnate or ſuffered; and now when Chriſt hath gone through the greateſt part of his task, he truſteth God the Father to make good his part, that <hi>he may fully ſee his ſeed, prolong his dayes, and that the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Lord may proſper in his hand;</hi> and certainly there cannot be any failing on either part. Now this Covenant of Redemption is the Plat-form and foundation of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace betwixt God and the Elect, there is the ſame number, and the like terms proportionably in both; hence it is that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a believer find an unfaithful, treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and unbelieving heart in himſelf daily departing from the living God, yet this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is built upon an higher and firmer Covenant betwixt God the Father and God the Son, which cannot be broken and diſanul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; the Father and Son cannot deceive or be unfaithful to each other; hence then it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to paſs that the Covenant and the mercies thereof are ſo ſure: I ſhall conclude this head with that notable paſſage of Chriſts to his
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:32941:42"/>Father upon this very account, Joh. 17.4. <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do,</hi> i. e. I have hitherto made good and performed the conditions of the agreement on my part, ver. 5. <hi>and now, O Father, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie me with thine own ſelf,</hi> i. e. make good thy part, in my exaltation: this with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Chriſts perſen, then for his ſeed and members, he tells the Father that he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his part to them, in manifeſting his name to them, praying for them, preſerving of them, and now when he was to leave them, he deſires the Father to do his part of the work <hi>in keeping thoſe whom he had given him,</hi> ver. 11. <hi>in ſanctifying and ſaving them,</hi> 17.24. and can we imagine but that God, will be faithful to his Son on the behalf of his Saints, certainly he will; for as they were Redeemed by the Son, ſo they were Elected by the Father, and as God the Father gave them to Jeſus Chriſt by election, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. and Jeſus Chriſt dyed for them, and ſo Redeemed them, ſo God the Son reſignes them up again to the Father, who will certainly keep them by his power through faith unto ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another thing conſiderable concerning the inſuring of Covenant-mercies by and through Jeſus Chriſt is, that theſe are moſt fully aſſured to us by the execution of Chriſts Mediatory Offices, both in his eſtate of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and exaltation: Let us here conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, 1. Chriſts Offices. 2. His States.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſts <hi>Offices</hi> are of three ſorts, as 1. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotal. 2. Prophetical. 3. Regal.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:32941:43" rendition="simple:additions"/> 1. As <hi>Prieſt,</hi> Chriſt inſures to us many Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant mercies, for he hath put himſelf in our ſtead, offered himſelf as a propitiatory <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> to ſatisfie divine juſtice, which is <hi>a ſweet ſmelling ſavour,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 5.2.</note> and of infinite value: hence it is that Chriſt is called <hi>a merciful and faithful High-prieſt in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people,</hi> Heb. 2.17. certainly remiſſion of ſins is one of the grand mercies of the New Covenant, and this Chriſt aſſureth as Prieſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As <hi>Prophet</hi> he reveals to us the will of his Father, opens to us the ſealed Book, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noints our eyes by his bleſſed ſpirit, the ſpirit of Chriſt inſpired the Prophets of the Old Teſtament,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.10, 11.</note> and the Apoſtles of the new in writing Scripture, and Miniſters in Preaching the Goſpel, and believers in diſcerning the meaning of the Word, and beauty of Chriſt: it is Chriſt as Prophet that writes his Law in Believers hearts which is one of the great mercies of the new Covenant: that inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens dark minds, and unlocks to us Divine Myſteries, and bringeth us from darkneſs to light.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As <hi>King.</hi> Chriſt Jeſus doth what he pleaſeth for the good of his Church, convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſubduing ſouls to himſelf, granting to them the ſpirit of power, love and of a ſound mind, ſoftening their hard and ſtony hearts maſtering their high and ſturdy Wills, awing, ordering, and centring their unruly, roving and raging affections, ſubduing their ſtrong corruptions, regulating their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:32941:43"/>begetting and increaſing their Graces, ſupporting them under and ſanctifying their afflictions,— all which Jeſus Chriſt as King works for his Covenanted ones.</p>
               <p>Yet more particularly in the ſecond place, let us conſider how our Covenant-mercies are aſſured to us by Jeſus Chriſt with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his <hi>two eſtates</hi> of humiliation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In his eſtate of <hi>exinanition,</hi> and <hi>humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> here I might run through the inſtances of his contemptible birth, his deſpicable life (<hi>i. e.</hi> to a carnal eye) his being in the form of a ſervant, having no form nor comelineſs, his hunger, thirſt, wandrings, revilings of men, wrath of God, rage of Devils, all theſe confirm the Covenant, if we believe the hiſtory of the Goſpel; but there's one thing more that put all out of doubt, and that is his real, ready and voluntary death, for as he had a power, ſo he had a will to lay down his life, and he dyed for the confirmation of this Covenant, and all the mercies thereof, a preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant proof of this you have in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. the ſumm of which Text is, that Jeſus Chriſt the great Mediatour of this new Covenant hath ſuffered death for the ſins of the elect that were committed againſt the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, whereby all true believers might have the benefits of the new Covenant more ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and immutably made over to them, and this he further comfirmes by the paralel caſe of a Teſtament and the Teſtatour even amongſt men, ver. 16, 17. <hi>where a Teſtament

                  </note> for while he is alive he may alter his Will at his pleaſure, or as reaſon requireth, but when the Teſtator is dead, the heirs may look after their Legacies: Jeſus Chriſt is the Teſtator, Saints are the heirs, the Legacies are theſe mercies of the Covenant; now the <hi>Teſtator</hi> is dead, the <hi>Legacies</hi> come clear, and the <hi>heirs</hi> of promiſe may claim their intereſt therein, there's no alteration of the Will when the Teſtator is dead, there's no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing, true Chriſtians now come to enjoy their eſtates; Chriſt emptied himſelf that we might be filled, he loſt his life that we might live, <hi>he became poor that we through his poverty might be rich,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt's <hi>exaltation</hi> doth much more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to us Covenant-mercies which conſiſts in, 1. His Reſurrection. 2. His Aſcenſion; and both theſe do abundantly confirm this to us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſts <hi>riſing again from the Grave</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us of the certainty of theſe mercies; for though he was dead, yet he is alive, and ſo lives to be his own Executor, if Chriſt had been detained Priſoner by the King of Terrours, we might groundedly ſuſpect that juſtice were not ſatisfied, nor mercies fully purchaſed; but <hi>he was delivered for our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and raiſed again for our juſtification,</hi> Rom. 4.25. and now he hath conquered death, and <hi>through death he hath deſtroyed him that had the power of death, that is the devil,</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:32941:44"/>and ſo hath delivered the heirs of promiſe from the fear of death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, 15. nay and by his reſurrection he raiſeth us to a new life of holineſs here, and a bleſſed life of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs hereafter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. with <hi>cap.</hi> 8.11.

               <p n="2">2. Chriſts <hi>Aſcenſion into Heaven</hi> inſures and ſecures Covenant-mercies to us, both as it ſets him in the holy of holies, far above the reach of men and Devils, and as he went before <hi>to prepare a place for us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 14 2.</note> he bids <hi>Mary</hi> to tell the Diſciples, Joh. 20.17. <hi>go to my Brethren and ſay unto them, I aſcend to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God,</hi> q. d. now you may be aſſured of your intereſt in God in a Covenant-way, for now I have done that work on earth that obſtructed your fellowſhip and obſcured your intereſt; ſo that now you may call him your God, and come unto him as your Father, without miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings within or challenges from without.

The efficacy thereof, <hi>he ſaves to the uttermoſt,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) i. e. to the uttermoſt point or term of life, even to death and beyond it, or ſo as none can mend his work, for as he is <hi>the author,</hi> ſo he is <hi>the finiſher of our faith and hope,</hi> conſolation and ſalvation, none can come after him to finiſh what he hath begun:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:32941:46"/>and he ſaves to the uttermoſt from all kinds of enemies, none can challenge an intereſt in ſouls after he hath done his work, and he ſaves to the uttermoſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> he leaves them not till he have brought them into the higheſt happineſs that Creatures are capable to enjoy: there is all manner of perfection in this ſalvation. 4. Here is the ſubjects or perſons ſaved, <hi>thoſe that come to God,</hi> or the condition, coming to God <hi>by Chriſt;</hi> now this is ſuch a diſpoſition as he himſelf doth work, for the power of his ſpirit doth effectually draw ſouls to God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44, 45. the condition is believing and he works the condition: Chriſt is that ſure Ladder of <hi>Jacob</hi> by which ſouls may aſcend to God, and into Heaven, never any fell off this Ladder, or miſcarryed that came to God by Chriſt. 5. Chriſts ability to carry on that work, in the firſt words, <hi>be is able,</hi> this we cleared in the firſt head concerning the union of the two natures; <hi>he is omnipotent,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is ſaid to be mighty to ſave, and if he can do any thing in this ſoul ſaving work, he will not fail thoſe that lay the whole ſtreſs of their ſouls upon him. 6. Here's his capacity to ſave, for the Text ſaith, <hi>he ever lives,</hi> a living Saviour can revive dying, dead ſouls: if Chriſt were not alive, there would be no hope of life by him, in vain ſhould we ſeek for living injoyments among the dead: but our Saviour is revived and lives for ever: <hi>he is the living Bread that came down from Heaven,</hi> Joh. 6.5. <hi>and is again riſen and aſcended up into Heaven, and becauſe he lives, we live alſo.</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:32941:47"/>7. There's his compleat execution of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent office: <hi>he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them,</hi> ſaith the Text, therefore muſt needs compleat the work he hath begun on earth, as the High-prieſt under the Law,

               <p n="3">3. Another ſort whom this Text and Doctrine confutes is the <hi>Arminians,</hi> and this in two reſpect, 1. In the buſineſs of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Redemption, 2. In the falling away from Grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Text ſaith theſe are <hi>the ſure mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of David,</hi> God's <hi>Davids</hi> or beloved ones have only an intereſt in them, not all men; and in the Doctrine, I ſay, <hi>that Covenant-mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies promiſed in Chriſt are purchaſed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by Chriſt to all the Heirs of promiſe,</hi> and I muſt add <hi>only</hi> to theſe, and to none beſides, and therefore Chriſt dyed not for all, and I ſhall only uſe theſe two Arguments, which immediately relate to the preſent ſubject: 1. <hi>Chriſts mediatory undertakings are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as a price for any but ſuch as were propoſed by God to the Mediator in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Redemption, to be Redeemed by him,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:32941:52"/>but all and every one were not ſo propoſed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not redeemed.</hi> I have before opened that great tranſaction betwixt the Father and the Son, now 'tis moſt certain that the Mediators death and ſufferings are to be lookt upon as regulated and qualified in reſpect of their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, according to what was propoſed by the Father, and conſented to by the Son; hence Chriſt ſaith that <hi>he came not to do his own will, but the will of him that ſent him, and to finiſh his work, and to give eternal life to as many as God had given to him:</hi> therefore Chriſt muſt by his undertakings enſure theſe mercies to all thoſe, and none but thoſe that the Father propoſed to him in this everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bargain; as for that conditional giving of ſome to Chriſt, which ſome ſpeak of, that would derogate from his glory, for he muſt needs know the event, and that ſuch a conditional giving would not effect it; and to ſay he would what ſhould not come to paſs, or to apply ſuch means as he knew would not be effectual to the end, cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined: beſides thoſe that are given to Chriſt are contra-diſtinguiſhed from others that are not given to him; therefore theſe only are aſſigned peculiarly to be redeemed and not others.</p>
               <p>Arg. 2. <hi>All thoſe and only thoſe whom Chriſt Redeemed, have all the mercies of the Covenant inſured to them, but all have not all the mercies of the Covenant enſured to them and conferred on them, therefore all are not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by Chriſt.</hi> Chriſt is the ſurety and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:32941:53"/>Mediator of the New Covenant; and he gives Faith, Repentance, Pardon, Heaven to them for whom he is engaged as a Surety, they ſhall not fail of all the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-mercies, that are abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, for he is faithful in the Execution of all his Offices; now we know all men have not ſaving Faith, nor Repentance; it cannot be conceived but that his ſatisfaction muſt be equally effectual for the procuring of theſe ſaving mercies to thoſe whoſe room he ſuſtained; and indeed God promiſeth as a recompence to him, that <hi>he ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul and be ſatisfied;</hi> yea <hi>he ſhall juſtifie many,</hi> i. e. as many as he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took for, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. if Chriſt hath born their iniquities, they muſt be juſtified, elſe he miſſed of his end; there is an inſeparable connexion betwixt Chriſt's undertaking for them, and his beſtowing Covenant-mercies on them: all that are Redeemed by Chriſt's Blood are made <hi>Kings and Prieſts to God,</hi> Rev. 5, 9, 10. they are purchaſed to be <hi>a peculiar people to God,</hi> they are <hi>waſhed from their ſins in his blood, redeemed from their vain Converſation, delivered from ſpiritual enemies to ſerve God in holineſs all their days,</hi> and <hi>to be received to Heaven when they dye;</hi> theſe are the mercies of the Covenant which the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator purchaſeth, and applyeth to all the elect, and to none but elect ſouls; therefore none elſe are Redeemed: for there is no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nor eternal mercy procured to any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate by Chriſt's death, for the proper and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:32941:53"/>native fruits of Chriſts death are not divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, therefore he prays for them that were given to him, and for whoſe ſake he did ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie himſelf,
<note place="margin">Joh. 17.</note> and excludes the reprobate World, for whom he purchaſed not theſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-mercies, therefore he dyed not for them: that's the former.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This point confutes <hi>Arminians</hi> in their ſad opinion of the Saints Apoſtacy; ſome hold a total, as <hi>Lutherans,</hi> others a final as <hi>Arminius,</hi> others maintain a total and final Apoſtacy of Saints; we hold that believing, regenerate juſtified perſons, that are endowed with the divine nature and a lively hope ſhall not loſe that principle and fall from that ſtate of grace, and be utterly deprived of the favour of God, and indeed we need no other Arguments but this, that theſe mercies of the Covenant are ſure mercies, which they would not be if they might be loſt; there is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability of Gods Promiſe in the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt for the Elect, the Omnipotency of the Shepherd of <hi>Iſrael</hi> who will not loſe one of his Sheep, the efficacy of the ſpirit, ſupporting and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeed of God, and life of Grace in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,

               <p n="1">1. It inſtructs concerning the great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the Covenant of Works and the Covenant of Grace. Divines uſe to give ſeveral differences betwixt them. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this is the main, that <hi>the former was conſiſting in an inherent righteouſneſs, the other in imputed;</hi> in the firſt man was to perform perſonal, perfect, and perpetual Righteouſneſs, in this ſecond our ſurety and great Mediator undertakes it for us, and it is applyed to us by faith, which is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Evangelical condition, in the room of that legal condition of compleat obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; ſo that was ſtruck betwixt God and man immediately, this through an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Mediator, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. the former was ſoon broken, becauſe though man was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, yet he was mutable and that we feel to our coſt; but Jeſus Chriſt the great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of this new Covenant is <hi>the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, the mighty God, the everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace, able to ſave to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; he is God and changeth not, therefore are not we conſumed, and therefore are ſouls ſaved:</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:32941:56"/>hence ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. <hi>He</hi> (i.e. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt) hath obtained a more excellent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, by how much alſo he is the Mediator of a better Covenant which was eſtabliſhed upon a better promiſe:</hi> indeed the excellency of the Covenant doth chiefly ariſe from the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Mediator of it, and the manner of its confirmation,
<note place="margin">Heb. 7.22. 9.15. 12.24. 1 Tim. 2.5. <hi>Verùm haec Apoſtoli comparatio ad formam potius quam admateriam referenda eſt.</hi> Calv. in loc.</note> which is Chriſt, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man by his active and paſſive obedience, who is frequently called our Mediator. Although that place in the <hi>Hebrews</hi> doth rather reſpect the form of adminiſtring the Covenant than the matter, and 'tis a compariſon betwixt the diſpenſation to the Fathers under the Law; and this in Goſpel-times, for they had the ſame Covenant, of Grace, though under Shadows and Types, that we enjoy in the ſubſtance and performance, yet by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it holds forth the precedency of our Goſpel-Covenant above, and beyond the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, which was made with <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That I may a little further open this, there are two things illuſtriouſly ſhining in this Goſpel-covenant. 1. The Grace and Love of God. 2. The Wiſdom of God, 1. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the infinite Mercy, Favour and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, the Tenderneſs, Love and Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention of the great God in renewing the Covenant which man had broken; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs there are many curious Queſtions asked concerning theſe two Covenants, as theſe: Could not God as well have ſecured the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the firſt Covenant by aſſiſting <hi>Adam</hi> with Grace to perform them, and perſevere
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:32941:56"/>therein? and again, Why might not the firſt Covenant have been ſpared, and this ſecond have ſerved the turn for both? But what is man that he ſhould find fault with Gods pleaſure? Yet we might anſwer all theſe with the aſſertion and admiration of Gods infinite wiſdom, and mercy. Gods glorious attributes are all ſeconds one to another, mercy imploys power, power backs truth, truth ſeconds juſtice, and they do all imploy wiſdom, and wiſdom doth order all to his glory; if there had not been a firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, there had not been a tryal of man's obedience, if it had been kept Gods wiſdom had not appeared, in repairing the breach, nor his love in ſending his Son, nor his juſtice and power in triumphing over Satans malice, or making advantage thereby: beſides if there had been no firſt Covenant violated, there could not have been ſuch a glorious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing of Free-grace in the reconciliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and man, which implyes both a Covenant and a breach. Oh the mercy of God in Chriſt! 'tis wonderful, ſtupendious mercy that God was willing to hold any correſpondence with man in a Covenant-way that had broken with him before. Yet free-grace would not truſt ſorry man with a ſtock any more in his own hands that had been a bankrupt: Yea God ſtayed not till man ſought out for this ſurety, but prevented him with Free-grace: we read that when <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> made a Proclamation, that whoever would bring him the head of <hi>Carocotta</hi> the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:32941:57"/>Spaniſh Pirate ſhould have a rich reward; <hi>Carocotta</hi> hearing of it came and preſented his head to the Emperour, and challengeth the reward; but when man had fallen he runs away, endeavours to hide himſelf, love purſues and overtakes him, and contracts with guilty <hi>Adam,</hi> a better, and unthought of, unſought for Covenant. <hi>Parmenio</hi>'s large Letter to <hi>Alexander</hi> againſt <hi>Olimpia,</hi> was all anſwered with one tear of a Mother: but where is any one tear to bewail or make amends for mans horrid crime? no not a word to procure this favour; Free-grace did all to bring Traitors into a League: God's heart was full; he could not hold but call he muſt, and ſeek and run to fetch home apoſtate man, that profligate Rebel, that durſt not ſhew his face, or ask forgiveneſs: but the Lord of life and glory, the King of Heaven is ready <hi>to forgive, and to give the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious things of Heaven to them that enquired not after them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Here behold ſuch a piece of wiſdom, as <hi>never eye beheld, ear heard, or heart conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> the Apoſtle calls it <hi>the manifold wiſdom of God;</hi> I cannot here ſtand to open all the parts thereof that fall within the reach of a finite view; I ſhall only endeavour to unfold one branch thereof, by clearing this ſtrange Paradox, <hi>viz.</hi> How it could be poſſible, ſince God himſelf is immutable; the Moral Law irrevocable, which is an obligation of the Creature to obedience, and man having now broken it, and death and wrath threatened
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:32941:57"/>thereupon; I ſay, whence it comes to paſs that the malediction and condemnation is not executed? no nor perfect obedience ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, as the nature of the Law requires? the direct and proper force of the Law is obedience, the ſecondary and conditional effect of it, is a binding over to the curſe upon ſuppoſition of diſobedience; yet we ſee the Law doth neither, and yet the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture teſtifies of the Word,

Luk. 16, 17.</note> that <hi>it's ſetled for ever in Heaven, the comforts are ſure and ſtand faſt for ever and ever, that one tittle of the Law cannot fade:</hi> How comes it to paſs then, that the Law is neither throughly obeyed nor executed? obeyed it is not,
<note place="margin">Rom. 3.20, 23. Rom. 8.1.

                  <hi>curſed is every one that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth not in all things which are written, in the Book of the Law to do them:</hi> therefore there is no way but one, that is, that the Law ſhould ſo far be diſpenſed with, as that a ſurety be accepted inſtead of the malefactor, this is the bleſſed deſign of the Goſpel; God is willing to allow, and accept a ſurety, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is willing to undertake and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this office; and the believer is willing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:32941:58"/>to embrace this bleſſed <hi>Mediator,</hi> and thus the match is made, and the Covenant is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, and the Law is eſtabliſhed: yea by this Goſpel-way of ſaving ſouls, he doth magnifie the Law, and make it honourable; the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of the Law are reconciled in <hi>Chriſt</hi> by the ſecond Covenant, our ſurety hath fulfilled its duties by his active, undergone its curſes by his paſſive obedience, and both better by Chriſt then ever it was poſſible for man to ſatisfie. <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency and the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical nature could not have obeyed the Law ſo perfectly, (at leaſt ſo meritoriouſly) as our ſurety hath done, and if we had lyen for ever in Hell we could not have ſatisfied ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſo as our <hi>Saviour</hi> did by his ſhort, yet infinite ſufferings ſatisfie for our woful breach of divine commands:
<note place="margin">Rom 3.31.8.2, 3, 4.</note> thus (it is often ſaid) is the Law eſtabliſhed, <hi>Chriſt</hi> was delivered to the Law, and we are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from it, and now believing ſouls are marryed to Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Rom. 7.4, 6.</note> and are no more under the malediction of it: God's grace num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth the Saints as Chriſt's ſeed, bindeth all in the ſame lump, and accepteth Man and Wife as one in a Law-ſence,

Oh ſtupendious contrivance of Free-grace! we cannot well conceive, nor ſufficiently admire the wiſdom of God in laying this bleſſed plot and plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of our Redemption; rich Grace, and profound Wiſdom, ſeem to outvye each other in this glorious fabrick: if every man, ſaith one, were as wiſe as an Angel, and every Angel, a Seraphim (a flame of Coeleſtial light of knowledge, and heat of love) they could never have found out ſuch an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to reconcile God and Man, the Law and it ſelf;
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.12.

That's the firſt inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another conſequence is this, if the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Covenant be made ſure in Chriſt, it lets us ſee the great difference betwixt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-mercies and common mercies, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and ſpiritual mercies. <hi>Saul</hi>'s mercies that God takes away, and the ſure Mercies of <hi>David</hi> founded upon the Covenant of

               <p n="1">1. They differ in the Fountain, Original, and riſe thereof, or in the affection of the giver, outward mercies proceed from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bounty, theſe Goſpel-mercies from ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial grace; the former from general muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, the other from peculiar benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, the former are but crumbs for dogs, theſe are bread for Babes, all things come alike to all,

               <p n="2">2. They differ in the dimenſions of the gifts, their Natures, Properties, and Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionables to the precious and immortal ſoul: Temporal mercies may indeed ſupply the outward man, the cloaths cover nakedneſs; fire may warm, meat may fill, and drink may

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:32941:60"/>thing, it cannot down with this courſe fare of common mercies, theſe Husks are for the Swine of the World; I muſt have Bread at <hi>my Fathers Table,</hi> my ſoul muſt have <hi>Angels food;</hi> or it will not like nor live, Lord let me have tender mercies, for my tender ſoul, otherwiſe I ſhall famiſh and dye, therefore he prays again, <hi>Let thy tender mercies come unto me that I may live,</hi> Pſal. 119.77. and again, ver. 132. <hi>Look upon me and be merciful, as thou uſeſt to do to thoſe that love thy name, David</hi> will not be content with any mercies but Saints peculiar priviledges, and ſuch as accompany ſalvation: theſe, theſe only fit and fill, ſuit and ſatisfie the gaping deſires of the immortal ſoul, but other things cannot; for you may as ſoon fill a ſack with wit, as a ſoul with wealth: Covenant-mercies are only proper for immortal ſouls; that's the ſecond difference.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They differ in their efficacy and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, in the effects and impreſſions they leave upon hearts, common mercies never make any better, but many worſe; Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-mercies always make the ſubject where they lodge abundance better, common mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies can no more ſanctifie, than they can ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie; a large ſhare of the World hath been a ſnare to many ſouls; theſe things are apt to puff up with pride, to ſteal the heart from God, to beget carnal confidence and ſecurity; which prove the bane of grace,

               <p n="4">4. Common-mercies and Covenant-mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies differ in their duration and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and this is the diſcriminating note in this Text, they are called Sure Mercies, in oppoſition to thoſe uncertain riches, <hi>that take to themſelves wings and fly away;

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:32941:61"/>us is not ours, but ſome others; and this is the certain end of theſe uncertain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments; that loſe them we muſt; and we know not when or how; and what a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will a poor worldling be in, when his God and he muſt be parted? But now theſe mercies of the Covenant are laſting, yea everlaſting mercies, they continue even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this tranſitory life, and run paralel with the life of God, and line of Eternity, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life is in the rear of ſpiritual life; Grace ends in Glory; yea an immortal Crown is one of the mercies of this ſure Covenant: theſe are a treaſure that is neither ſubject to inward decays nor outward violence, <hi>no Moth can corrupt it, nor Thief ſteal it,</hi> Mat, 6.19, 20.</p>
               <p>Well then, ſince this be the vaſt difference betwixt common and Covenant mercies; why ſhould we make ſo great account of the former, and ſo little of the latter? what need have we to advance our hearts and eyes to things that are not ſeen with bodily eyes, and not dote upon things that are ſeen?

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:32941:62"/>of God or good men, but ſpiritual will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you truly good; the world will take its ſudden farewell of you and fail you at your greateſt need, Covenant-mercies will ſtick by you while you live, and bring you blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs before his Throne in Eternal glory: here will come in that uſual diſtinction of <hi>Bona throni,</hi> and <hi>Bona ſcabelli,</hi> 'tis theſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-mercies that are the good things of the Throne; outward mercies are but the good things of the foot-ſtool; let Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born ſouls mount up to the mercies of the Throne, but let the Moon and all ſublunary injoyments be under their feet; the whole World is too little for the godly man's ſoul, not but that we ſhould be thankful for the leaſt common mercy; but we ſhould not be put off with the greateſt; a little of the World ſhould content a Chriſtian with God, all the World ſhould not content him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God; Oh how ſweet are common-mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies when they come to us in a Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? a morſel ſprinkled with Chriſt's blood hath a delicate relliſh, this only takes away the poyſon, venom, and malignity that guilt hath brought upon the Creature, and reduceth all things to their priſtine uſefulneſs, and primitive perfection. Oh the happineſs of the Saints! they have all they do enjoy as ſo many tokens of love; as its ſaid that <hi>Cyrus</hi> his kiſs to <hi>Chryſantas</hi> was better Gold than the coſtly Cup of Gold that he gave to <hi>Artabarus.</hi> So common mercies perfumed with Covenant-love are trancendently better
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:32941:62"/>than the richeſt Treaſures of wretched Worldlings: that's the ſecond inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another inference is this, if Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercies be thus ſure, then it inſtructs us in the precedency of Grace above gifts,
<note place="margin">Gifts come upon other terms than Grace, God gives grace as a free-hold, it hath the promiſe of this and another World, but gifts come upon lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: though a father will not caſt off his Child, yet he may take away his fine Coat, and ornaments, if he be proud of them. Mr. <hi>Gurnal. Chriſt. ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</hi> Mat. 25.29. Luk. 8.18.</note> there are gifts of illumination, conviction, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, elocution, Prayer, Propheſie, which are given for the Churches edification; the main difference betwixt gifts and grace is that the former may languiſh, vaniſh and utterly periſh, but Grace never totally and finally decays; God may give <hi>Saul</hi> a ſpirit of Government, <hi>Judas</hi> a gift of Preaching and Miracles, <hi>Simon Magus</hi> a temporary faith, and yet repent him of theſe and pluck them quite away: he may and often doth dry up the right arm of an Idol idle ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, and darkens his right eye of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.17. ſo that he improves not Talents of gifts, <hi>from him ſhall be taken away that which he hath,</hi> even real gifts and ſhews of Grace, perſons eminently gifted may be fire-brands of Hell: men may fall from the cleareſt intellectuals to bruitiſh ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality; but theſe gifts and callings of ſaving grace are without repentance; <hi>God loveth his own to the end,</hi> gracious habits ſhall not be loſt; the Apoſtle elegantly expreſſeth the difference to my hand, in 1 Cor. 13.8. <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity (i. e.</hi> ſaving grace) <hi>never faileth but whether there be Prophecies, they ſhall fail, whether there be Tongues, they ſhall ceaſe; whether there be knowledge it ſhall vaniſh
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:32941:63"/>away:</hi> I know the main intent of the place is to commend love above other ſaving graces from the duration and perpetuity of it, that it ſhall continue and be of uſe in Heaven; yet here 'tis oppoſed to ſuch gifts as may alſo be loſt in this life; and however by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it will follow, that the one is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from its ſubject the other not: natural men may make a fair ſhew and flouriſh with fine gifts, which are, as it were, the trimming and ornament of Grace, which yet may through negligence or old age decay and wither, true grace may be accompanyed with the guildings and varniſh of gifts, which may in time wear off, whilſt a ſound prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple continues freſh and lively. Beſides this, give me leave to add other four diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes betwixt common gifts and ſaving graces.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They differ in reſpect of their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and ſpring, the original from whence they flow,
<note place="margin">Eph. 16.7.</note> 
                  <hi>gifts</hi> (as one ſaith) <hi>come from Gods treaſury of bounty,</hi> Grace proceeds from the choice Cabinet of his Love, <hi>Grace flows to the elect, through the blood of Chriſt from Gods bowels of tender love;</hi> gifts proceed from the hand of God as an act of munificence upon his ſons glorious aſcention and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat inauguration; and 'tis one thing to eat meat at the Kings table, and another thing to gather the fruits of Royal Grace upon ſome ſolemn day, as that was of <hi>Davids,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.19. Saints only have the Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces, hypocrites may have a large ſhare
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:32941:63"/>in theſe gifts, nay a larger portion then ſome Saints themſelves: <hi>Saul, Balaam, Caiaphas</hi> may have the gift of Prophecy; <hi>Judas,</hi> he may Preach,
<note place="margin">Praeſtat credere quam mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula edere.</note> but <hi>Thomas</hi> and the elect only can believe, and it's a greater work, ſaith <hi>Luther, to believe, than to work miracles:</hi> that's the firſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They differ in their nature and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of operation; Covenant-grace ſtamps on the elect-ſoul the image of our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is the divine nature; God's moſt cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious workmanſhip, the idea and pourtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, the repreſentation and exemplar of God bleſſed for ever; grace is Gods picture (if I may ſo ſpeak) drawn to the life; 'tis a forming of Chriſt in the ſoul, now gifts are no ſuch thing; the devil himſelf hath great gifts, yet hath razed out the image of God; gifts are but the works of Gods pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and wiſdom, ſuch as the Sun and Starrs; yea even the flies and atomes, they are in a ſort dead, and we may call them Gods lumber; ſome have noted that gifts are only the effects,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.3. Gal. 5.22.</note> but graces are called the fruits of the ſpirit: the one is the husk of a common profeſſion, at leaſt the ſhell of ſome rare endowments; but the other is the kernel of ſincerity, and fruit of a Goſpel-converſion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They differ in their train and retinue, as to gifts none have all, either of all ſorts, or any great eminency in all, hence 'tis ſaid, 1 Cor. 12.8, 9—<hi>to one is given the word of wiſdom, to another knowledge,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Moſes</hi> had a gift of Government, not of Eloquence;

When Chriſt aſcended, he gave gifts to men, —for what end? the Apoſtle tells us <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints, for the Work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 4.8,—12: But now the end of Grace is the ſouls ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual advantage, that by them Chriſt might take poſſeſſion of the heart, that the ſoul may have ſome life and principle of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to beloved corruptions, and thereby be

               <p>III. THe third <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe is, of <hi>Examination,</hi> to try us whether we have a real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in theſe ſure mercies of the Covenant, it is one of the greateſt queſtions that we can be asked, whether we have a right title to Covenant-mercies? alas we have forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our title to God, or to any good thing from him, by our breach of the Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and now we have nothing to do with God, except only to endure the ſevere ſtrokes of his ſin-revenging juſtice. Oh what need have we to try our ſelves by an impartial ſcrutiny? For our better aſſiſtance in this great and weighty buſineſs, I ſhall a little open what it is to enter into Covenant in general, and then enquire what conditions of the new Covenant we can find in our hearts, and then ſhew a little of the nature and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of theſe Covenant-mercies where they are.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, to enter into Covenant with God is to own God as our God, and to give up our ſelves wholly to him as his; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in theſe words in Scripture, <hi>I will be thy God and thou ſhalt be my people,</hi> this, this is the Marrow of the Covenant, for God to be our God, it is a comprehenſive word, it is [<hi>ſubſtantia faederis</hi>] as <hi>Funius</hi> calls it, [<hi>anima faederis</hi>] as <hi>Pareus</hi> calls it, [<hi>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put foederis</hi>] as <hi>Muſail;</hi> the ſubſtance-ſoul,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:32941:68"/>and head of the Covenant, the life of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in this, as one ſaith ſweetly, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of duties lyes in Adverbs, and the ſweetneſs of the Covenant lyes in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives.</p>
               <p>Well then, the contracting of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant betwixt God and a ſoul conſiſts chiefly in a mutual reddition, or giving up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves each to other, expreſſed in Scripture by a Matrimonial contract, when God gives up himſelf to the ſoul, and accepts of him, and the ſoul accepts of God as his God, and gives up himſelf to him, now we are not to enquire after the act of God, for 'tis fully expreſſed in the Scriptures, and it is certainly ſuppoſed God accepts the ſinner, when the ſinner accepts of God, for theſe are relatives, nor is this any change in God, the change is only in the ſinner, who is now put into a new ſtate and relation; it is certain by the free offers of the Goſpel, that God doth conſent, and the main thing to be enquired into is whether the ſoul do conſent or no; for if it cordially do, the match is made, God and the ſoul are marryed, which is a thing of the greateſt importance in the whole World; I ſhall purpoſely wave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies in this buſineſs wherein this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent lyes, whether it be only an aſſent,

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:32941:69"/>thereof, and diſcerning a poſſibility of a recovery and the way of reconciliation by a new Covenant contrived and contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed betwixt God and fallen man, ſealed and confirmed, by the blood of a Mediator, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, doth freely, cordially, and conſtantly accept of God as his chiefeſt good, and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate end, and give up himſelf to him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvedly, unreſervedly, and univerſally, to be the Lords; to be and do what the Lord plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, to obey divine commands, be at God's diſpoſe in life and death, and thus to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue even to the end of his days.</p>
               <p>This is for a ſoul to enter into Covenant with the Lord, the tryal will lye in theſe two things; 1. Whether we have accepted of God as our God: 2. Whether we have given up our ſelves to him, to be at his diſpoſe, yea or no? a little of both theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether have you taken the Lord to be yours, or no.

Alas perſons may ſay fair in a fluſh of affection, but enquire you into the frame of your ſpirits and actions whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you be real.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This ſelf-delivery to God is ready, free, willing, and chearful, not with grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and by compulſion; when perſons do it becauſe they cannot help it, when they ſee they muſt dye, and can ſerve the Devil no longer, or under the rod, only they will be for a fit and ſtart religious; but it is full fore againſt their wills, for they would rather chooſe to be ſlaves to luſt, but they are taken off by violence or conſtraint, or elſe they lye under ſuch terrours and convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that for preſent they are over-awed, and dare not but profeſs to be the Lords, it is ſtrangers that yield feigned or forced obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to our <hi>David.</hi>

Well ſirs, how is it with you; do you voluntarily, and cheerfully ſurrender your ſelves to the Lord, as a Maid doth in Marriage to the perſon ſhe loves? are your hearts ſo gone after the Lord, as to look upon it as your greateſt preferment, to be joyned to ſo ſweet an Husband? have

<note place="margin">Cant. 6.12.</note> doth your ſoul make you like <hi>the Chariots of</hi> Amminadab, or a willing people? and the longer you ſerve this Maſter, the better do you like this ſervice: You do not repent that you gave up your names to him, if it were to do again, you would do it, though you knew of ten thouſand times more troubles in your way than yet you have met with; nay you thank God heartily that he will accept of your perſons and ſervices: and you look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſervice as perfect freedom: is it thus with you, bleſs God, he hath brought you into Covenant.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Covenanted ſoul delivers up it ſelf to God reſolvedly; there are ſome that halt between two opinions, that are off and on; one while they will be for God, another while they are ſtaggering, like the <hi>Samaritans:</hi> when the <hi>Jews</hi> were in proſperity, they would profeſs to be of their ſtock, when in adverſity they diſowned relation to them, theſe are a Cake half-baked, the one ſide baked for God, the other ſide dough; ſo that one cannot tell what to make of them; God likes not theſe unfixt unreſolved ſpirits: but a real Saint will have God whatever it coſt him; like a Woman, that will have ſuch a Man, though ſhe beg with him; friends may ſet their hearts at reſt, there's no diſſwading her, for her affections are placed, all bonds cannot hold her; juſt thus is it with a poor

               <p n="4">4. A gracious ſoul delivers up it ſelf to God, unreſervedly, entirely, and univerſally, and that both with reference to the ſubject, and the ſeaſon, the whole ſoul, and that for ever, 1. <hi>Totally.</hi> 2. <hi>Finally,</hi>

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:32941:82"/>more awe your conſcience to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, than the examples of moſt or beſt of men? do you with <hi>Zechariah</hi> and <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> walk in all the ways of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments blameleſs? do you take heed to your ways that you offend not with tongue or hand or foot? do you worſhip God in the beauty of holineſs? do you make it your buſineſs to ingage your hearts in your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to God? do you lift up your hearts in Gods ways, that God and you may meet? do you worſhip God in the ſpirit, rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, not having any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the fleſh? in a word, do you gladly follow Chriſts example, ſtudy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to him, and communion with him? is faith working by love? and doth that love ingage you to keep Gods commands, and render them not grievous but pleaſant? do you account Chriſts yoke eaſie, his burden light, and his ſervice perfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? and are you conſtant and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in holy walking all your days? and though you may ſtumble and fall, or turn aſide, or ſtand ſtill, or turn back, yet you dare not quit and forſake Gods ways or chuſe the ways of ſin, to go aſide with the workers of iniquity, but you lament your miſcarriages, are reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs till you get into Gods ways again, plead hard for pardon, are more jealous over your hearts, make more haſte God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and ſo through grace, keep faithful to death that you may receive a Crown of life.</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:32941:82"/>
               <p> Thus I have gleaned up the conditions or diſpoſitions of Gods Children which are promiſed by God, purchaſed by Chriſt, and effectually wrought by the bleſſed ſpirit in the hearts of the elect, and theſe are the mercies of the Covenant, by which you may try whether you be intereſted in the Covenant; for if you find theſe new-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-mercies in you, you may conclude you have an intereſt in new Covenant-pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges.</p>
               <p>Another way of tryal (which I ſhall but briefly hint at) is to diſcover the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and effects of new Covenant-mercies, upon the ſouls of ſuch as partake of them; <hi>i. e.</hi> thoſe benefits and priviledges of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as Reconciliation, Adoption, Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſin, imputation of Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and the reſt before-mentioned leave gracious effects upon the hearts of ſuch, as partake thereof— Take a taſte;</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are transforming conforming mercies, they change heart and life, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; yea, and they make the ſoul argue from mercy to duty; that ſoul that partakes of theſe mercies, dare not ſin, that Grace may abound, nor argue from mercy to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful liberty, much leſs make Chriſtian liberty a cloak of laſciviouſneſs; oh no, that's the devils Logick, a Child of God thinks and thus reaſons, did Chriſt dye for me, and ſhall not I dye unto ſin, and live unto him that dyed for me? ſhall my dear Saviour ſhed his blood for me; and ſhall I think
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:32941:83"/>any thing too dear for him? ſhall he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give much to me, and ſhall not I give all I have to him? ſhall not I love him much? pray much, obey much? O my ſoul, how canſt thou chuſe but live in new obedience? doth not the love of Chriſt conſtrain thee? hath he reconciled thee to God, and God to thee; and wilt not thou be reconciled to thy offending brother? hath he forgiven thee ten thouſand Talents, <hi>gratis,</hi> and wilt not thou forgive ſuch as offend thee a few farthings for Chriſts ſake? hath God given thee himſelf and doſt thou withhold any part of thy poor, ſilly, ſorry ſelf from him? nay here I am, let him work in me, and do with me as ſeems good in his eyes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are chearing, comforting, and refreſhing mercies; theſe mercies of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant will anſwer all objections, clear all ſcores, and put the ſoul out of doubt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning its ſtate. Let the Devil and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing heart conſpire together to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Conſcience, yet one word of the bleſſed Covenant will baffle all their arguings, and ſtop their mouths, and ſtill the ſoul; let God ſpeak out and ſay, I am thy God in Covenant, who then can cauſe trouble? this was all <hi>Davids</hi> Salvation, Deſire, and Conſolation. One drop of this holy Oyle of the Covenant will ſweeten a whole Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Sea of the bitter Waters of the ſharpeſt afflictions; a taſte of the Covenant will turn Water into Wine; this is the Tree caſt into the bitter Waters of <hi>Marah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 33.24.</note>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:32941:83"/>that makes them ſweet; ſenſe of pardon takes away the ſenſe of the pain: if a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular promiſe can ſo comfort a ſoul, as it may be called a cordial. Oh what comfort will the Covenant afford? which is a cluſter and conſtellation of Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal promiſes, the good things of the new Covenant keep head above Water, and heart above terrour in all conditions: theſe ſteel the ſoul with courage in difficulties, comfort in Adverſity, and an Antidote in proſperity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe mercies of the Covenant are raiſing, reviving, elevating mercies, they lift the heart above the World, and advance it to Divine Coeleſtial objects and Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<note place="margin">Rev. 12.1. Col. 3.1. Phil. 3.8, 9.</note> a Chriſtian thus cloathed with the Sun, hath the Moon under his feet, and all Sublunary enjoyments at his heels; Chriſt and things above lye next his heart; other things are droſs and dung in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon thereof; a Covenanted Chriſtians Treaſure is in Heaven, and his heart is there; he preferrs a grain of Grace to all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the World; common mercies will not content his heart, or quiet his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; he opens his Heaven-born ſoul to Heavenly influences; he can eaſily wink all the bravery of this lower World into black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and deformity, and pitty the ſottiſh ſenſleſs ſons of men that take up their reſt below, and neglect the main concernments of Eternity. Ah, thinks the gracious ſoul, what fools are theſe that chaſe theſe guilded
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:32941:84"/>vanities, and pant after the duſt of the Earth? would to God they did but ſee with theſe enlightned eyes that Gods ſpirit hath helpt me to. Oh that they did but taſte the ſweetneſs of that Grace that my ſoul is enamoured with, they would thirſt after the World no more, but long for God, yea this living, loving God, and never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent till they come to appear before God. How bleſſed are they that have their ſins pardoned, hearts purged, ſouls reconciled? that have God for their portion, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for their inheritance and eternal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?</p>
               <p n="4">4. The mercies of the Covenant are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging and encreaſing mercies; the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian that hath them is like the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>grows ſtronger and ſtronger;</hi> theſe are tending to perfection, and make the ſoul ſtrive and thrive in holineſs;

Oh ſirs, examine your hearts herein, how do you come on and increaſe

               <p>IV. THE fourth Uſe is of Conviction, Redargation and Reprehenſion, and this falls heavy on the heads, 1. Of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. 2. Of Saints.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the mercies of the Covenant be ſure mercies (as we have cleared fully) Oh what folly are thoſe ſouls guilty of that are Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, graceleſs, careleſs ſouls, that have no inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in theſe mercies, and never trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about enſuring theſe Covenant-mercies to their own ſouls; how many in the World are deſtitute of theſe mercies? there is a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Men and Women that live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the pale of the viſible Church, that may be called <hi>Lo-Ruhamah,</hi> for they have not yet obtained mercy; nay, in the ſtate they are in, there is no mercy for them, becauſe they are not yet in Chriſt, through whom theſe Covenant-mercies flow: unconverted ſouls are unconcerned perſons in theſe mercies; theſe dogs have nothing to do with this Childrens Bread; and yet who ſo apt to catch and ſnatch theſe precious dainties? they love to hear the glorious priviledges of believers laid open, as Juſtification, Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, Adoption, and eternal life; and yet we muſt ſadly ſay they have nothing to do with theſe: if they hear Diſcourſes of Gods mercy, how are they pleaſed, tickled, and even raviſhed? and they make no
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:32941:85"/>queſtion but they ſhall be ſaved, as well as others; and they think ſurely God that made them will not damn them, but ask theſe poor ſouls whether they be ſavingly converted, renewed, ingrafted into Chriſt by faith? alas they know not what this means; they never asked their own ſouls the queſtion; nay, they are ready, to think that is a very needleſs enquiry, or impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to know; however this never lay upon their Hearts and Conſciences, as neceſſary in order to clearing up this great caſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have obtained mercy: But let all ignorant ſots know that <hi>he that made them will not have mercy on them,</hi> Iſa. 27.11. let all prophane Rebels againſt the King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven know that <hi>God will not be merciful to any wicked Tranſgreſſor,</hi> Pſal. 59.5. Gods At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes are all Analogal and Correſpondent; he will not ceaſe to be juſt and holy that he may be merciful, he will be merciful in his own way; Mercy and Covenant ſhall go hand in hand; 'tis a ridiculous folly for men to conceit, they ſhall have the Mercies of the Covenant that are not within the Covenant; this is that fallacy that <hi>Logicians</hi> call <hi>(falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia dividendi conjungenda)</hi> of dividing things to be conjoyned; 'tis moſt dangerous and damnable in Divinity, when ſouls dream of having peace without grace, happineſs without holineſs; but let men know there's no mercy but in the Covenant, where no ark of the Covenant no ſeat of mercy, where there's no work of Grace, there's no Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

<note place="margin">Job 11.20. c. 8.14.</note> and ſwept away as the Spiders Web into the fire of Hell. Oh for a ſoul that hath all his days been building Caſtles in the Aire; the Houſe of his fair profeſſion upon the ſliding ſand of Fancy and Imagination, to have all come tottering down with one puff of death, will be a dreadful ſight. Miniſters told them of this, but they would not believe, nor ſuſpect their ſtate, or ſpend one hour in ſearching whether they were right or no; many a time were they warned of the danger: but they pleaſed themſelves in wilful ſelf-deluſion; and now they are paſt recovery: they would not be brought
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:32941:88"/>to an holy deſpair in themſelves, that they might have ſure footing in theſe ſure mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and now they ſhall and muſt deſpair of ever having part or portion in theſe ſweet and certain mercies: they would not be beaten from their carnal ſhifts and ſenſleſs Pleas, and now they muſt and ſhall be for ever baniſht from them; and feel the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them: Miniſters could not deal with them, but God can; and it will be an heart-confounding day, when the varniſh ſhall be waſhed off, and all rotten props ſhall be pluckt up, that kept the ſoul from hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and they ſhall ſee themſelves deceived by Satan, the World, and their own ſelf-flattering hearts into eternal miſery.</p>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:32941:89"/>with wicked men in their jollity and frolick fits, but their month of ſorrow is approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either here or hereafter; and oh the bitter pangs and travels that ſhall then poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs them? in this World they would not conſider, but hereafter they ſhall have an Eternity to conſider of theſe Covenant-mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, though in a hopeleſs way: as 1. They ſhall think of the nature of theſe mercies they have loſt. Oh how free, how ſweet, how ſuitable, how ſatisfying were they? how ſure would God have made them to them? and the better theſe mercies, the bitterer their ſorrow in the loſs of them. 2. They ſhall think that once they might have enjoyed them, and have been happy in that enjoyment; once they had a day of grace, means of grace, miniſters per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, ſpirit moved, mercies, afflictions, word, rod, every thing ſpoke this language. Oh embrace theſe mercies, but I refuſed; and now they are out of my reach. 3. They ſhall think, and think again, how near they were to the embracing of theſe mercies; Oh what convictions did God faſten on my heart by ſuch and ſuch a Sermon! I was once half-perſwaded to embrace them, how near was I to a full cloſure? I went home with ſtrong reſolutions to be another man; but this deceitful heart beguiled me, and ſo I put off repentance till now it be too late. 4. They ſhall think what theſe mercies would have done for them; theſe mercies would have infolded their ſouls in the arms
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:32941:89"/>of Gods love; theſe would have filled their ſouls with Grace, fitted them for Gods uſe, and furniſhed them for glory, theſe mercies would have rendred them profitable in life, comfortable in death, and happy for ever; the poſſeſſours of theſe mercies are gracious Saints; Yet again, 5. They ſhall think with ſadneſs what they have exchanged theſe mercies for; they have paſſed off theſe ſweet and ſure mercies for traſh and trifles, for dung and dirt, for a little ſtinking pleaſure or ſtinging profit, which now they have left behind them in the World, and only carry the guilt and ſhame along with them, which muſt abide them, when ſenſual delights are vaniſht away. Oh what gnaſhing of teeth and indignation at themſelves will this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get for their former madneſs? 6. They muſt think how many thouſands of ſouls were made happy by a gracious cloſure with and full enjoyment of theſe mercies; perſons whom they deſpiſed in the World, and thought not worthy to come in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, ſhall ſit down with the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles in Heaven; but theſe wretched ſouls are thruſt out. Oh, will a damned wretch think, I might have been happy as well as yonder ſhining Saint; he was a ſuffering Creature, I was a rejoycing miſcreant; now he is comforted, and I am tormented. Yet, once more, 7. The damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Hell ſhall bethink themſelves who was in the fault, and whence it comes to paſs that theſe mercies were not made ſure
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:32941:90"/>to their ſouls; and they can charge none herewith but themſelves: they will then ſee that none was to be blamed but their own wilful wills, whatever they may object here, and boaſt that they are willing, yet God lays the blame there, and ſo ſhall they, will they, nill they, they muſt be ſpeechleſs, and only charge themſelves as making faggots to burn them in for ever. Oh, will the ſoul think, I may thank my ſelf for this; I wilfully for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook my own mercies by obſerving lying vanities; this is the fruit of mine own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, I would needs be damned; Miniſters and Godly friends perſwaded, God ſtopt my way by his Providences, Ordinances, but I would run into the pit, and here I am ſhut up in eternal darkneſs; wo be to me, that ever I was born. Oh that I had either never heard of or embraced thoſe mercies, that I have rejected, and that will follow my ſoul with horrour for ever.</p>
               <p>Ah ſirs, I beſeech you conſider, ſuch a day will come, and then you'l remember theſe things, and they will lye heavy upon you, then you'l feel what an evil and bitter thing it is that you have forſaken God: then you'l vomit up your ſweet morſels, and remember theſe ſweet words that here you deſpiſed,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 141.6.</note> then you'l remember the poſſibility and probability you were once in, of obtaining theſe ſweet mercies; now they are attainable; but if once you have ſet a ſtep upon the ſhore of Eternity, You are paſt hopes and remedy, for the dead and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:32941:90"/>damned do only hear the ſound of wiſdom with their ears,
<note place="margin">Job 28.22.</note> but are never likely to enjoy the benefit thereof. Oh put not off theſe things with ſome ſlight and tranſient thoughts; but ſhame yourſelves to an holy diligence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another ſort to be reproved, are Gods own children that are guilty of four foule faults: 1. They are apt to indent. 2. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound about theſe mercies. 3. They do not live upon: Or 4. Not up to theſe mercies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Gods Children would have the mercies of the Covenant; but then they have a mind to indent with God to be ſecured from the croſſes attending theſe mercies; the fleſh ſhrinks and is loath to ſuffer; we are like <hi>Orpah,</hi> we would follow Chriſt a little way, but fain would we make our bargain ſo, as not to follow him in foul way: But ſirs, conſider would you have the ſweets and not the bitter of Godlineſs? did you not take Chriſt (in a marriage-covenant) for better and worſe? will you pick and chuſe with him? do not right virgin-ſouls follow the Lamb whither-ſoever he goeth? Ah ſirs, this Covenant-relation is an expreſs, voluntary, univerſal, unreſerved ſelf-reſignation: the bearing of the Croſs was always ſuppoſed and implyed;
<note place="margin">Mat. 10.37, 38. Mark 10.30.</note> and if you will not have him with it, you are to be without it; for the Croſs is <hi>[Evangelii genius]</hi> the very inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable property, complexion, and companion of the Goſpel: and Chriſt would not have
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:32941:91"/>any cheated with imaginary hopes of immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from ſufferings, <note place="margin">Luk. 14.28.</note> but tells them the worſt, and bids them ſit down and count the coſt; and if you did not ſo at firſt, you are not yet ſincere, and if you did, and ſtill would have Chriſt; why do you now grumble at bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that which you freely choſe. Beſides, know it, Croſſes for Chriſt are ſpecial Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-mercies, for afflictions are adopted to be real mercies of the Covenant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are promiſed as well as any other mercies, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.31, 32. and <hi>David</hi> ownes afflictions as an act and fruit of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-faithfulneſs, <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.75. ver. 67.71.</note> becauſe it fetcheth him from his wandrings, inſtructs him in Gods ſtatutes, and therefore was good for him. Croſſes for Chriſt never did any hurt, but have been uſually means of good, many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have bleſſed God for them; God ſees we cannot live or like well without them; <hi>Paul</hi> gloried in the Croſs of Chriſt, took pleaſure in diſtreſſes for Chriſt, and why then are we afraid of them, or would indent to be ſecured from them: be aſhamed of your nice and delicate ſpirits.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some Chriſtians are too too apt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound with God about theſe Covenant-mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; <note place="margin">In cloſing with offers of Grace, we muſt be uniform: earthly things God is pleaſed to retail: all have ſome, none have all: but in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Treaſure, he will not break the whole piece, and cut it into Remnants; if God would cut off as much as would ſerve mens turn, he ſhould have cuſtomers enough. Mr. <hi>Gurnal Chriſt. ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour — pag.</hi> 310.</note> my meaning is, they do not look and make out for the whole chain, compoſition and combination (as I may ſay) of Covenant-mercies,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:32941:91"/>they are willing and content to be put off with ſome, and do not ſue for all: they can apply ſome promiſes, not others; ſee a neceſſity of pardoning-mercy, but do not plead and act-faith for purging, ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, quickning, enlightning mercies of the Covenant. Conſider, Chriſtians, by this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 1. You prejudice your ſelves, you need all theſe Covenant-mercies; there's not one of the fore-mentioned mercies, that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian can live and thrive without; all are of great uſe, every one hath its peculiar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, a gracious ſoul cannot ſpare any of them; nay, 'tis a ſin for it to be content with leſs than God hath promiſed; he that's not for all, is truly for none at all: the true owner will not divide: in one part of your life or other, you'l want all Covenant-mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; it's baſe unworthineſs and ingratitude to ſlight any of them. 2. You diſhonour God, and diſparage theſe mercies, as if God were not able to give you all, and pay the whole debt of his free and full promiſe; as for example, ſuppoſe a rich Tradeſman owe you a ſumm of money, and you come to him and tell you are willing to abate him ſo much, and compound with him, and take of him a ſhilling in the pound, or a pound in the hundred for the whole debt, he looks upon himſelf as diſparaged, being a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Chapman, he will not have his ability or honeſty queſtioned; but quickly anſwers, what do you think I am breaking?

Oh Chriſtians, chide your ſelves for your ſinful mannerlineſs and modeſty; and widen your contracted ſpirits for larger in-comes of Grace and Mercy.

               <p n="3">3. God's Children do not live upon theſe mercies of the Covenant; we blame them that have good eſtates, and live beſides them; and well we may, for it's a baſe and a beggarly practice, when perſons have enough, but want power to eat, take their portion, and enjoy the good of all they have; <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5.18, 19.</note> this is a ſore evil, and a ſad curſe, and the contrary is good, comely, a ſweet bleſſing, and the very gift of God: and Oh what a ſad evil for the Saints of God, heirs of Promiſe to live off their Eſtates, none

I know legal fears and terrours are good in their kind, to drive the ſoul out of it ſelf, and unto Chriſt; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards a ſpirit of love beſt becomes a Child of God; hence ſaith the Apoſtle, Rom. 8.15.

But alas, ſirs, how unwilling and forced, are many of our performances? how grumbling are we in our actings for God? we go to God as though it were our burden, not with that delight and chearfulneſs we ought: conſider ſirs, how readily God offers us mercy; how freely Chriſt laid down his life for us; how ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable a work it is to the bleſſed ſpirit to apply theſe mercies to us; and be aſhamed to be ſo ſour and dull in your performance, yea, conſider the diſpenſation you are under; a Goſpel-Covenant, made up of mercy, and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:32941:98"/>this ſhould ripen our fruits to more ſweetneſs and maturity than the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-diſpenſation: as you know <hi>Apricocks</hi> and other fruit that are upon a Wall under the direct influence or powerful reflection of the Sun-beams are ſooner ripe and ſweeter when ripe than ſuch as are in the ſhadow; ſo our fruits in Goſpel-times ſhould be better than theirs under the Law: but alas, how far do we fall ſhort of <hi>Davids</hi> warm ſpirit for God? or the holy acts put forth by the Saints of God under types and ſhadows, when theſe ſweet mercies were not ſo clearly revealed to them, and the Sun of Righteouſneſs beat not ſo hot upon them! Ah Chriſtians, if you would ſtudy mercies more, your ſpirits would be in a better frame for duty: <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will come into thy houſe in the multitude of thy mercy, and in thy fear will I worſhip toward thy holy Temple,</hi> Pſal. 5.7. obſerve it; the ſenſe of Gods mercy is an excellent ingredient in the Worſhip of God; yea, it begets an holy awe of God; for theſe two are very conſiſtent; and indeed nothing is ſo prevalent a motive to duty, and diſſwaſive from iniquity, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive to the exerciſe of repentance, as ſenſe of mercy is: this truth Scripture and experience will abundantly confirm. But I have been too large on this ſubject: only let Gods Children be humbled for their too too legal ſpirits; and breath after a more Evangelical Spirit by the ſtudying of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:32941:99"/>theſe mercies, rather than poring upon guilt and wrath.</p>

Oh fearful ſtate! it was ſad to be under the curſe of a mortal man; <hi>Cham</hi> found his Father <hi>Noah</hi>'s curſe heavy; but oh how heavy is the curſe of Almighty God, who with a word can ſend the ſoul into Hell; and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his ſtroke into another World? dear friends, who would live in this curſed ſtate another hour? on the contrary, whoſoever hath theſe mercies of the Covenant hath all bleſſings bleſſed; yea, and alſo croſſes; and, in a ſort, curſes are turned into bleſſings: who would not be covetous of ſuch a ſtate? But to haſten.</p>

Without theſe Covenant-mercies the ſoul is not accepted in its choiceſt duties: neither perſon nor performance is owned by God; it is only upon a Covenant-account that any are accepted; indeed in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works the perſon was accepted for the works ſake, but in the Covenant of Grace, God accepts the perſon firſt, then the work; if the man be in Chriſt, then
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:32941:101"/>the offering is taken in good part, though it be but a Turtle-dove or young Pigeon, though but a ſigh or groan; God takes a Poſie of Flowers [of ſweet-ſmelling Graces] though mixed with ſtinking Weeds, and pricking Bryars of vanity and corruption, gathered by a Child, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed by Chriſts Mediation, and is better pleaſed therewith, than with the moſt odoriferous gifts of uncoverted ſouls, where the heart is deſtitute of Covenant graces:

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:32941:103"/>and ſo for the reſt of the Graces; there's not an useful diſpoſition requiſite to qualifie us for Gods ſervice, but 'tis contained in the Covenant; hereby we ſhall know Gods will, be willing to obey it; delight our ſelves in Gods ſervice, as <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 5.7. <hi>I will come into thy houſe in the multitude of thy mercy, and in thy fear will I worſhip towards thy holy Temple:</hi> we ſhall then <hi>ſing in the ways of the Lord, and in the height of</hi> Zion, <hi>and flow together for the goodneſs of the Lord</hi>— Jerem. 31.12. <hi>i. e.</hi> the goodneſs of the Lord will engage the Saints to come with chearfulneſs into Gods preſence, and thank God for an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of waiting on ſo good a God: holy hearts delight in holy works; grace fits the ſoul for God; Covenant-mercies render a ſoul capable of and ſuitable to Covenant-duties; and the more you partake of theſe mercies, the more delight will you take in duty: the more like you are to God, the more delight will you take in God; and God will delight more in you; and ſo there will be ſweet fellowſhip betwixt God and your ſouls: on the contrary, carnal ſpirits cannot endure ſpiritual exerciſes; they come to duties as a Bear to the ſtake, and when they are therein, they are upon a Rack; Lord be merciful to ſuch a ſoul.</p>

               <p>Let me therefore perſwade all graceleſs Children to look about them; do you above all others take heed of miſcarrying; greater expectations are from you than others; the ſurviving friends of your Religious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors look after you, and enquire what you do; oh rejoyce their hearts by walking in the ſteps of your predeceſſours; I ſhall beſpeak you, yea charge you, in the words of Reverend Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi> upon his death-bed, that none of you will dare to meet us at the great Tribunal in an unregenerate ſtate: let every Child of Godly Parents plead for Covenant-mercies, as once <hi>Solomon</hi> did, 2 Chron. 1.8, 9. <hi>thou haſt ſhewed great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy unto</hi> David <hi>my Father — now O Lord God, let thy promiſe unto</hi> David <hi>my Father be eſtabliſhed</hi> — thus do you plead with God, and ſay, Lord my Parents embraced the Covenant; it was thy free-grace to chooſe them, and ſet thy heart upon them; and is that Grace weary? canſt thou not own me with Covenant-mercy? nay, doſt thou not call that mercy to <hi>Abraham</hi> by

               </p>
               <p>I have but hinted at theſe things, becauſe 'tis an ordinary ſubject wherein many have done worthily to promote endeavours to obtain aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Sirs, what ſay you to theſe things? is not aſſurance of intereſt in Covenant-mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies worth labouring for? can you let theſe things lye without clearing your title? doth not the new creature breathe after it? doth not a rational ſoul deſire it? do not all wicked men catch after a certainty, and frame to themſelves ſome kind of certainty? do not worldlings take care to ſecure their Lands, Goods, Eſtates? ſhall they require Bonds, Seals, Oaths, Sureties, and yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all this too little, and ſhall we account any thing too much to ſecure theſe ſweet mercies whithout which we are undone for ever? Oh let nothing hinder your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours this way; let no objections make you delay or be diſcouraged; let not Satan deter you, or the Worlds conceits make you ſlight it as unattainable, nor a ſlothful unbelieving heart obſtruct your diligence in
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:32941:124"/>this great and weighty caſe; who would live at ſuch uncertainties as the moſt do? who would have his life to hang in doubt in a meer conjecture? eſpecially when it is in this great caſe of Conſcience, whether the ſoul muſt live in Heaven or Hell? but moſt of all conſidering that our very lives are ſo uncertain that the next moment we may ſtep into Eternity; the God of Heaven awake the Saints of God who have indeed an intereſt in theſe mercies to uſe all means to know they have an intereſt therein, that they may know they are of the truth, and aſſure their hearts before him, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19.</p>

THE fourth and laſt head of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, that I promiſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound is an anſwer to this Queſtion, How a gracious ſoul that is intereſted in theſe mercies is to behave himſelf? though this be a neceſſary point, yet I muſt cut ſhort in it, having inſiſted too long on the former Heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Believe and receive theſe mercies, <hi>this is a faithful ſaying and worthy of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation,

                     </note> that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.15. is it the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition only that is to be credited, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced? is it not Chriſt and the reſt of the Covenant-mercies held forth in this precious maxim, which is the ſweeteſt flower in the Garden of Scripture, the choiceſt Pearl in the Word, and moſt glorious Star in the whole Conſtellation of Goſpel-promiſes? who dare doubt what God hath ſpoken? and who dare refuſe what God doth offer? he is ſo wiſe that he cannot be deceived, and he is ſo good that he will not deceive you; you may better believe God than your own ſenſe; give glory to God by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing theſe mercies, deny or diſpute no longer: be not ingrateful to that Grace of God, that hath condeſcended ſo low to give you evidences, on purpoſe that you might believe.</p>

                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:32941:136"/> 2. Improve theſe ſure mercies, make uſe of them in all your particular needs, if a man have a good ſpring he will order it for convenient ſupplies of many houſhold wants, and draw it through ſeveral chanels for ſeveral uſes: ſo a Chriſtian muſt branch out the ſeveral mercies of the Covenant to his various caſes and uſes, as enlightning mercy to his darkneſs, enlivening mercy to his dulneſs, pardoning mercy in caſe of guiltineſs, purging mercy in caſe of ſtrong corruptions,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12 7.</note> — becauſe Gods grace is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for us in all exigencies; in all ſtorms there is Sea-room enough in Gods infinite mercy for faiths full ſail,
<note place="margin">Phil. 4.19.</note> our God ſupplies all wants; Religion is a ſpiritual bond to tye God and a ſoul together, and a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in the exerciſe of his Religion ſingles out that in God which is needful to him on all occaſions: the life of faith is a retailing of Divine commodities, as the Covenant of grace gives a ſoul a title thereto (as it were) by whole-ſale. Oh let the heirs of promiſe improve theſe mercies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be content with theſe mercies, theſe are ſufficient to make you happy, ſeek not further to eke out your contentment in the Creature, as though you had not enough in having theſe; what a ſtrange paſſage is that of good <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

O yes, all this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unleſs God give him a Child, he takes no notice of this in compariſon of a Son; this is juſt our caſe, let God give us himſelf and Covenant-mercies, we can overlook all theſe in our diſtempered fits, and look upon them as of no worth if he deny us ſome outward comfort that our hearts are ſet upon: but this is our ſin and ſhame, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not God himſelf content us? can we go from Covenant-mercies to mend us with common-mercies? nay do we not thereby weaken our intereſt, diſhonour our portion, and diſ-ingage God to help us? is not God a jealous God, and can he endure to have any corrival with him in your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>

               <p n="5">5. Be active and paſſive for theſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, they coſt Chriſt dear to purchaſe them; do not you think any thing too dear to do or endure for promoting or preſerving of them: kindneſs is very endearing to a grateful heart; your pains cannot be ſpent to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter purpoſe than in the cauſe of God, we muſt always be paying our debt, though we can never fully pay it, we muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind-hand with God, but let a ſoul under the ſenſe of mercies ſweat blood for God, if he call to it: you ſow not in a barren ſoul, as ſhowrs of mercy ingage you to fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; ſo an abundant crop of mercy will be your ſure reward: and in your ſaddeſt Winter you ſhall have the ſweeteſt harveſt of mercy; if Chriſtians knew what grapes of Coeleſtial <hi>Canaan</hi> they ſhould taſte in their Wilderneſs-ſufferings for Chriſt, they would not be ſo afraid of them as they are; theſe mercies run moſt freely and ſweetly when other ſtreams are ſtopt: fear not ſufferings, mercies will meet and ſupport you.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Plead theſe mercies for your poſterity, though you ſhould leave your Children thouſands a year, yet theſe Covenant-mercies
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:32941:137"/>will be the beſt portion; you cannot aſſure your eſtates to your heirs, but theſe are ſure mercies, ſo that if you take hold of Gods Covenant, plead it, live up to it, you ſhall have the benefit of theſe your ſelves, and ſome (at leaſt) of your Children and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours ſhall enjoy the ſame mercies, for God will remember theſe unto a thouſand generations, though he be not bound to every individual ſoul of your natural off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, however the Scripture fully ſhews that this is the ſureſt way to obtain a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for your Children; tell God, they are more his than yours, you are but Nurſes for his Children; tell the Lord, that thou muſt dye and leave them, but he lives for ever, intreat him to be their loving everlaſting Father; tell him that though thou leave them ſomething in the world, yet that is neither ſuitable nor durable, but theſe ſure mercies will not fail them, and comfort your hearts for your houſe and family with the laſt words of dying <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.5. oh labour to tranſmit your title unto God to future generations, as the two Tribes and an half did to future Ages by their Altar <hi>Ed. Joh.</hi> 24.24, 28. ſee 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Breathe after a full poſſeſſion of theſe ſure mercies, they are from everlaſting to everlaſting, follow them to the ſpring in admiration and thankfulneſs, and follow this ſtream of Covenant-mercies to the Ocean of Eternity; indeed the ſtreams are in time to the Sons and Daughters of men,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:32941:138"/>but the original is without a beginning, in God eternal thoughts of love, and the end is without end in thoſe everlaſting embraces in Heaven; oh long to ſee the end, if theſe mercies be ſo ſweet here, what will they be in Heaven, in their proper Element, as it were? oh that bleſſed ſtate, that Paradice of pleaſure, that joy of our Lord, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſome, an houſe not made with hands, a City with foundations, a Crown, a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom! art thou the happy product of theſe ſure mercies of <hi>David?</hi> do theſe mercies bring forth ſuch felicity? oh happy day that my ſoul hath an intereſt in theſe ſure mercies, but how long ſhall my ſoul be kept from the full poſſeſſion of theſe mercies? when ſhall I come and appear before God? how long ſhall I ſojourn in <hi>Meſech,</hi> and be detained from my Fathers plenteous Table above? ſhall not a Captive long for his deliverance, and a young heir for his full inheritance? and ſhall not my ſoul long to be with Chriſt above? ſhall my body be ſo weary, and hath not my ſoul more cauſe to be weary of its burden and abſence from home?

               <p>VII. THE ſeventh Uſe of Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Comfort and Refreſhment, and here's an abundant ſpring opened to revive all the heirs of Promiſe. But becauſe I want room, and becauſe much of that which hath been already delivered tends this way, I ſhall rather improve it, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the people of God and heirs of Promiſe to the great and ſweet duty of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
               <p>And here I might elarge upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Uſe, Comfort and acceptance of the duty of praiſe in the account of God and men; but I muſt wave that, and only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on ſome few particulars that concern the nature of theſe mercies, which may ingage us to be thankful, which are theſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are free-mercies, they may be had without money or price, ſaith this Prophet here,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quanti O bomines profiteremini vos eſſe empturos, ſi ſalus aeterna venderetur! ne ſi paeto tum qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem qui totus aureo ut eſt in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulis fluit fluento, quis dedcrit, pro ſalute juſtum pretium numera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verit.</hi> Clem Alex. adm. ad gentis.</note> free-grace was the Fountain, Cauſe, and Original of theſe; he had mercy becauſe he would have mercy; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing moved his bowels of mercy on our part; free-grace had no impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive cauſe but it ſelf: when you are to purchaſe theſe mercies, the price it fallen to
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:32941:139"/>juſt nothing, he gives liberally and upbraids not: oh what cauſe of thankfulneſs and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration?</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are Dear mercies, this doth not contradict the former, they are dear to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, but free to us, they are purchaſed with the warmeſt blood in the veins of the Son of God; yea, he thought his deareſt heart-blood well beſtowed to purchaſe theſe ſure mercies; he ſees of the Travel of his ſoul and is well ſatisfied; the fruits of his purchaſe are the joy of his heart; he thinks theſe worth all his pains, pain and dolours; God the father is well pleaſed and accounts theſe mercies a valuable fruit of his Sons purchaſe; and ſhall not we be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful?</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are Deep mercies,
<note place="margin">Aquae quo ſunt profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diores, eo ſunt puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ores, quoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am &amp; craſſa &amp; terrea materia in profundum depreſſa eſt, —hinc pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funditatem a quarum bibea. <hi>Ezek. 34.18.</hi>
                  </note> high and broad, and have all the dimenſions of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.5, 6. theſe mercies can fetch up a drooping deſpairing ſoul out of the grave, yea out of Hell; be the ſoul ſunk as low as ſin can make it in this World, theſe mercies can fetch it up, and raiſe it out of the grave and pit of ſilence, and ſave to the uttermoſt: Oh what a long arm of mercy hath been reached forth unto your troubled hearts in your low eſtate? and doth not this deſerve thankfulneſs?</p>
               <p n="4">4. They are Deſigned mercies, purpoſely deſigned, aimed and intended to ſet forth riches of grace, the infinite contrivance of the bleſſed God to magnifie riches of love to ſinners; 'tis true God intended to ſet
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:32941:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>off his power, wiſdom, juſtice, truth, but he hath magnified his mercy above all the reſt of his name; it's beyond the reſt of his works, the attributes of God are ſet very high, but mercy ſits in the chiefeſt Throne; he declares to Angels and Saints what he can do for ſorry man: oh advance free-grace.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They are Dignifying mercies, ſuch honour have all his Saints; oh what an height doth God raiſe his Covenant-Children to? he deals bountifully with them, by theſe Covenant-mercies was <hi>David</hi> raiſed up on high,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 23.1.</note> and therefore confeſſeth, that God <hi>regarded him according to the eſtate of a man of high degree,</hi> 1 Chron. 17.17. and truly it is the higheſt preferment in the World to partake of theſe ſure mercies: and therefore we have great cauſe of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They are Sanctifying mercies, they ſeaſon all other mercies, and make common mercies to become Covenant-mercies; yea, they make croſſes, mercies, they perfume the moſt offenſive griefs, and are like <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s Tree that ſweetens the Waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> if you poure a paile of Water on the floor, it ſeems a little Sea, but pour it into the Ocean it's ſwallowed up and ſeems nothing; ſo afflictions out of the Covenant are intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, but as in Covenant-love they are inconſiderable, the depth of mercies drowns the depth of miſeries, and is not this ground of thankfulneſs?</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:32941:140"/> 7. They are Separating mercies, hereby are Gods Children diſtinguiſhed from all the people that are upon the face of the Earth,
<note place="margin">Exod. 33.16, 19.</note> even in their finding grace in Gods ſight, and his preſence with them, and making his goodneſs paſs before them; if there be any diſcriminating mercies for any of the Children of men, as protection, proviſion, direction, theſe Covenant-mercies uſher them in, and ſort them out to the heirs of Promiſe, and if they be good for them, they ſhall partake thereof; then bleſs God.</p>
               <p n="8">8. They are Sealing mercies, they ſignifie exhibit and repreſent Gods love to the ſoul, where-ever theſe mercies are laid up in the breaſt of a ſinner, that ſoul is the <hi>Jedidiah,</hi> or beloved of Gods ſoul, they teſtifie ſuch a ſouls relation to God, and Gods affection to it; wicked men are ſtrangers to Covenant-love, Gods people are the proper ſubjects of theſe endeared thoughts of Gods heart, and are you of that number? oh give God the glory of this mercy.</p>
               <p n="9">9. They are Extenſive mercies, they are exceeding broad, they have wide arms, and embrace all the heirs of Promiſe, not a gracious ſoul (though never ſo poor) is left out, yea they are largely extended to every Chriſtians ſtate, caſe, exigency, and neceſſity: let doubts be what they will; let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
